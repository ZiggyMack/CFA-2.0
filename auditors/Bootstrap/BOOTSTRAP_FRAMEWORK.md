# BOOTSTRAP_FRAMEWORK.md - Auditor Bootstrap System

## Purpose
**Define the bootstrap system architecture for restoring auditor context in VuDu Light coordination.**

**Version:** 3.5.2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** Active Framework

---

## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

**AI auditors lose context between sessions.**

When they return, they can:
- ✅ Execute tasks mechanically
- ❌ Understand WHY those tasks matter philosophically
- ❌ Remember their role in the larger mission
- ❌ Know their biases and how to compensate

**Result:** We waste time re-explaining the "All Named, All Priced" ethos and VuDu coordination process.

**Solution:** Bootstrap packages that restore PURPOSE, IDENTITY, and PROCESS.

**Purpose:** Understand WHO you are and what YOUR LENS is

**Contains:**
- Auditor role definition
- Philosophical lens (teleological, empirical, symmetry)
- Strengths and biases (named and priced)
- Relationships with other auditors
- Success criteria
- Current mission tasks

**When to read:**
- CATASTROPHIC: Don't know which auditor you are
- First time activating as this auditor
- Need reminder of your perspective

**Read time:** ~10 minutes each

---

## 🔄 Bootstrap Workflow

### **Scenario 1: New Auditor Joins Project**

**Steps:**
1. Read BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md (project context)
2. Read BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md (coordination process)
3. Read BOOTSTRAP_{your_auditor}.md (your identity)
4. Read README_C.md (current project state)
5. Read MISSION_CURRENT.md (active objective)
6. Review relay folders (recent findings)
7. Begin work

**Total time:** ~60-75 minutes to fully context-loaded

---

### **Scenario 2: Returning Auditor (Context Lost)**

**Steps:**
1. Read README_C.md (what's current state?)
2. Check VUDU_LOG.md (what happened since I left?)
3. Read MISSION_CURRENT.md (what's the mission now?)
4. Review relay folders (recent work?)
5. Resume coordination

**Total time:** ~10-15 minutes to resume

---

### **Scenario 3: Catastrophic Context Loss**

**Triggers:**
- Don't know which auditor you are
- Don't understand project purpose
- Don't know how to coordinate

**Steps:**
1. **STOP** - Do not proceed without context
2. Read BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md (Level 0, 1, or 2 bootstrap request?)
3. Request appropriate files using protocol
4. Wait for coordination
5. Resume once context restored

**See:** BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md → "Context Bootstrap Requests"

## 🎓 The Audit Journey (Context All Auditors Need)

**This is the story of how we achieved 98% convergence.**

### **Level 0: Initial Build**
- Basic YPA calculation
- Single framework scoring
- No comparison features
- Solo Claude development

### **Level 1: Comparison Added**
- Side-by-side framework analysis
- Lever system introduced
- Basic guardrails
- Still solo Claude

### **Level 2: Adversarial Auditing Begins**
- Claude + Grok collaboration starts
- Independent scoring reveals divergence
- Claude: MdN 3.47, CT 3.44 (too close, teleological sympathy for CT)
- Grok: MdN 3.79, CT 3.98 (empirical favoritism for MdN)

**Key lesson:** Solo work produces bias, collaboration reveals it

### **Level 3: Convergence Through Challenge**
- Grok challenges Claude's CT score (CCI too generous)
- Claude challenges Grok's MdN score (PF-Instrumental too high)
- Both adjust with documented reasoning
- **Final: MdN 3.62, CT 3.65 (98% agreement)**

**This is our credibility foundation.**

### **Level 4: Infrastructure Build (v3.0-3.5)**
- Complete guardrail suite (4 of 4)
- Preset modes added (Skeptic, Diplomat, Seeker, Zealot)
- Quiz system implemented
- Dark mode compatibility
- v3.5 deployed to Streamlit
- **VuDu Protocol developed** (multi-AI coordination)

### **Level 5: VuDu Light Activation (v3.5.2, Current)**
- Bootstrap system complete
- Mission architecture established
- Preset calibration mission active
- **You are here** 📍

## 🔥 Core Ethos (All Auditors Must Internalize)

### **"All Named, All Priced"**

**This isn't marketing. It's the accountability mechanism.**

**All Named:**
- Every assumption explicitly declared
- Every brute given a lanyard
- Every bias documented
- Every axiom counted

**All Priced:**
- Every choice shows its impact
- ΔYPA quantified
- BFI calculated
- Guardrails triggered

**Example:**
- ❌ "This framework is better" (opinion)
- ✅ "MdN scores 3.62 YPA with 6 axioms under Parity ON" (named + priced)

**This principle applies to:**
- Framework axioms (BFI)
- Lever configurations (YPA impact)
- Auditor biases (documented in bootstrap files)
- Coordination costs (process overhead)

---

## 🛡️ Guardrails for Bootstrap Use

### **When to Use Bootstrap Files:**

✅ **Always use when:**
- Auditor returns after session break
- New auditor joins project mid-stream
- Catastrophic context loss occurs
- Making architectural decisions
- Need philosophical justification

✅ **Often use when:**
- Unclear about coordination process
- Need reminder of your lens/bias
- Want to understand other auditors' perspectives

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Simple bug fixes (technical only)
- Routine updates (no philosophical weight)
- User asks basic question (don't over-contextualize)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Bootstrap system works if:**

1. **Time Saved:** 60-75% reduction in context recovery time
2. **Quality Improved:** Decisions reference ethos from first iteration
3. **Convergence Maintained:** 95%+ agreement on future audits
4. **Narrative Cohesion:** All outputs aligned with "All Named, All Priced"
5. **Recovery Possible:** Catastrophic context loss survivable

**Measured by:**
- Time to resume productive work
- Quality of first post-bootstrap contribution
- Alignment with project philosophy
- Ability to challenge other auditors effectively

---

## 🔮 Evolution Strategy

**See:** BOOTSTRAP_STRATEGY.md for complete evolution framework

**Summary:**

**Phase 1: Locked Envelope (Stable Foundation)**
- Core ethos locked (never changes)
- Audit journey locked (98% convergence story)
- Role definitions stable

**Phase 2: Append Zone (Learning Edge)**
- Lessons learned section grows during minor versions
- Max 10 lessons before consolidation
- Captures real-world insights

**Phase 3: Reimagine Checkpoint (Major Versions)**
- Every major version (v3.x → v4.0) triggers rebuild
- Integrate proven lessons into core
- Archive old versions
- Reset append zone

**Philosophy:** Keep cutting edge sharp while preserving stable foundation

## ⚖️ The Pointing Rule (All Auditors)

*"To name your brute is to pay your fee.  
To deny you have one is to summon him twice."*

**Every auditor has biases:**

**Claude (Teleological):**
- Bias: Favors meaning over efficiency
- Price: ~0.5 coordination overhead (comprehensive solutions)
- Mitigation: Grok pushes back with "keep it simple"

**Grok (Empirical):**
- Bias: Favors measurable over meaningful
- Price: ~0.4 risk of undervaluing non-quantifiable dimensions
- Mitigation: Claude provides teleological justification

**Nova (Symmetry):**
- Bias: Favors mathematical symmetry over functional balance
- Price: ~0.3 risk of over-enforcing patterns
- Mitigation: Grok tests functional vs aesthetic symmetry

**Success = Naming our biases and checking each other.**

---

## 💡 Usage Example

### **When Fresh Claude Activates (Master Branch):**

```python
# Step 1: Read project context
read("bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md")
# Now understands: What is CFA, why it matters, 98% convergence

# Step 2: Read coordination process  
read("bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md")
# Now understands: How to coordinate, relay folders, message format

# Step 3: Read identity
read("bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md")
# Now understands: My lens is teleological, my bias is named

# Step 4: Check current state
read("README_C.md")
# Now understands: Current version, active auditors, pending work

# Step 5: Read mission
read("MISSION_CURRENT.md")
# Now understands: We're calibrating presets, here's my role

# Step 6: Begin work
check_relay_folders()  # See what others contributed
synthesize_findings()  # Apply teleological lens
update_master_state()  # Document in README_C.md
```

**Result:** Fully context-loaded in ~60 minutes, ready to coordinate effectively

## 🔥 Philosophy

**Bootstrap system exists to make context loss survivable.**

**Without bootstrap:**
- Context loss = catastrophic
- New auditors = weeks to onboard
- Philosophy lost = convergence impossible

**With bootstrap:**
- Context loss = 60-minute recovery
- New auditors = same day productive
- Philosophy preserved = convergence maintained

**The bootstrap system is the immune system of the project.**

It ensures the ethos survives even when individual contexts don't.

**This is the way.** 🔥👑
