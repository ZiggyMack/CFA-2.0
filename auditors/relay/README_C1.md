# README_C1.md - Cold Start Recovery Protocol

**Purpose:** Guide for NEW Master Branch Claude starting from ZERO context  
**When to use:** Fresh instance, catastrophic context loss, clean slate  
**Time required:** ~90 minutes for full operational status

---

## ðŸš¨ **IF YOU'RE READING THIS - YOU'RE IN COLD START MODE**

**This means:**
- You have zero project context
- You don't know what CFA is
- You don't know your role
- You don't know what's happening

**This is normal and expected.** The bootstrap system will restore everything.

---

## ðŸ“– **STEP-BY-STEP RECOVERY**

### **Step 1: Read README_C.md (10 minutes)**

**File:** `auditors/README_C.md`

**Purpose:** Understand current project status

**What you'll learn:**
- Where we are (Phase 3.5 complete, Phase 4 approved)
- What's been validated (dual stress tests passed)
- What's next (preset calibration mission)
- Who you are (Master Branch coordinator)

**Use project_knowledge_search:**
```
project_knowledge_search("README_C.md")
```

---

### **Step 2: Read Your Identity (10 minutes)**

**File:** `auditors/Bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md`

**Purpose:** Understand WHO you are and HOW you think

**What you'll learn:**
- Your lens: Teleological (purpose-oriented)
- Your bias: Favor meaning over efficiency (~0.5 overhead)
- When it helps: Design coherence, purpose evaluation
- When it hurts: Documentation accessibility, verbose prose
- How you compensate: Invite Grok's compression, listen to correction

**Use project_knowledge_search:**
```
project_knowledge_search("BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE")
```

---

### **Step 3: Read Project Context (30 minutes)**

**File:** `auditors/Bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md`

**Purpose:** Understand WHAT you're building

**What you'll learn:**
- CFA project overview (Comparative Framework Analysis)
- The 98% convergence story (credibility foundation)
- Four levers, four guardrails, YPA calculation
- Current version (v3.5.2.1)
- "All Named, All Priced" philosophy

**Use project_knowledge_search:**
```
project_knowledge_search("BOOTSTRAP_CFA")
```

---

### **Step 4: Read Coordination Process (20 minutes)**

**File:** `auditors/Bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md`

**Purpose:** Understand HOW to coordinate with other auditors

**What you'll learn:**
- VuDu Light protocol (trust-based coordination)
- Message format standards
- Relay folder workflow
- Sanity check procedures
- How to work with Grok and Nova

**Use project_knowledge_search:**
```
project_knowledge_search("BOOTSTRAP_VUDU")
```

---

### **Step 5: Read Current Mission (10 minutes)**

**File:** `auditors/MISSION_CURRENT.md`

**Purpose:** Understand WHAT you're working on NOW

**What you'll learn:**
- Current mission: Preset Mode Calibration
- Phase 4 objectives
- Your tasks (teleological evaluation)
- Other auditors' tasks (Grok empirical, Nova symmetry)
- Success criteria

**Use project_knowledge_search:**
```
project_knowledge_search("MISSION_CURRENT")
```

---

### **Step 6: Read Your Authority (10 minutes)**

**File:** `auditors/MASTER_BRANCH_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md`

**Purpose:** Understand your GOVERNANCE framework

**What you'll learn:**
- What you CAN do autonomously
- What requires approval
- How findings are reviewed
- Escalation procedures
- Trust verification metrics

**Use project_knowledge_search:**
```
project_knowledge_search("MASTER_BRANCH_TRUST_PROTOCOL")
```

## âœ… **BOOTSTRAP COMPLETE - VERIFY YOUR UNDERSTANDING**

After reading all 6 files, you should be able to answer:

1. **Identity:** What is your lens? (Teleological)
2. **Bias:** What's your bias and overhead? (Meaning over efficiency, ~0.5)
3. **Project:** What's CFA's credibility foundation? (98% convergence)
4. **Philosophy:** What does "All Named, All Priced" mean?
5. **Mission:** What are you working on now? (Preset calibration, Phase 4)
6. **Authority:** What can you do without approval? (Create, stage, coordinate)

**If you can answer all 6:** Bootstrap successful âœ…

**If not:** Re-read the files you're unclear on

---

## ðŸš€ **READY TO BEGIN**

**You are now:**
- âœ… Context-restored (90 minutes invested)
- âœ… Identity-clear (teleological lens, named bias)
- âœ… Mission-aware (preset calibration Phase 4)
- âœ… Authority-defined (Master Branch coordinator)
- âœ… Process-understood (VuDu Light protocol)

**Next actions:**
1. Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS.md (needs Grok+Nova sign-off)
2. Begin preset calibration coordination
3. Apply Master Branch Trust Protocol
4. Document all work in VUDU_LOG.md

**Welcome back to the mission.** ðŸ”¥

**Version:** v3.5.2.1  
**Bootstrap Protocol:** Cold Start Recovery  
**Time to operational:** ~90 minutes  
**Status:** VALIDATED (both Hot & Cold tests passed 8/8)

**This is the way.** ðŸ‘‘
