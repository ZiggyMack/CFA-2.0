# REPO_LOG.md - Repository Change Log

**Purpose:** Track granular file-level changes, task movements, and documentation updates  
**Scope:** Everything too small for CHANGELOG.md or VUDU_LOG.md  
**Maintained by:** Any auditor making changes to repository structure  
**Format:** Reverse chronological (newest first)

## ⚡ QUICK START

**First time using this log:**
1. Ctrl+F "CHANGE LOG"
2. See examples of real entries
3. Copy an example that matches your use case
4. Update the fields, increment Entry ID
5. Update category pointer at top

**Finding what you need:**
- Need task status? → Search TASK_MOVEMENT
- Need pending items? → Search PENDING_ACTIONS
- Need validation history? → Search VALIDATION

---
## 🎯 **COORDINATION CHECKPOINT** (Update This!)

> **CRITICAL:** If you just made repo changes, update the relevant category pointers below!  
> Each category has its own skip pointer for targeted reading.

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

**"Multiple entries same date, same category - which Entry ID?"**
→ Always start from -1, increment for each additional

**"Entry fits multiple categories - which skip pointer to update?"**
→ Update ALL relevant category pointers

**"Forgot to update skip pointer - what now?"**
→ Add a correction entry, update pointer retroactively

### 📊 **Skip by Category:**

**Master coordinators: Jump to your needed category and search for its Entry ID.**

---

### 📖 **How to Use Category Pointers:**

**If you're adding a log entry:**

1. **Assign Entry ID:** `[CATEGORY-YYYY-MM-DD-N]`
   - Use relevant category tag
   - Use today's date
   - N = increment number (1, 2, 3...) if multiple entries same day in same category
   
2. **Add entry to CHANGE LOG section** below with:
   ```markdown
   ### [ENTRY_ID] 2025-10-29 - Description
   **Categories:** [CATEGORY_TAG] [OTHER_TAG]
   ```

3. **Update category pointer(s) above:**
   - Find each relevant category
   - Update "Last Update" date
   - Update "Skip to Entry ID" 
   - Increment "Entries Since Coordination"
   - Update "Active Items" if STAGED/PENDING

**If you're consulting the log:**

1. **Find your category** above (e.g., TASK_MOVEMENT)
2. **Copy the Entry ID** (e.g., `TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1`)
3. **Search in file:** Ctrl+F for that Entry ID
4. **Read from there forward** in that category
5. **Skip everything before it**

**Example: Multiple entries same day**
```
Oct 29 has 3 task movements:
  Entry 1: [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1]
  Entry 2: [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-2]
  Entry 3: [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-3]

Skip pointer: TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1
(Reads all 3, since searching for -1 finds first entry)
```

**Example: Same date, different categories**
```
Oct 29 entries:
  [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1] - Task archived
  [VALIDATION-2025-10-29-1] - Validation complete
  [DEPLOYMENTS-2025-10-29-1] - Files deployed

Each category pointer uniquely identifies which entry to start from!
```

**After coordination:**
- Reset "Entries Since Coordination: 0" for category you processed
- Leave pointer at current ID (next entry will increment)

**When to read full log:**
- Historical research
- Understanding file evolution
- Debugging "where did this file go?"
- NOT for routine coordination (use category pointers!)

---

- `[STRUCTURE]` - Directory changes, reorganization
- `[ARCHIVE]` - Files moved to ~Archive/

**Multiple Tags Allowed:**
```markdown
**Categories:** [TASK_MOVEMENT] [DEPLOYMENTS]
(Entry is both a task movement AND a deployment)
```

### **Status Values:**

**DEPLOYED** ✅
- Changes made directly to repo files
- Already in version control
- Ready for use
- No follow-up needed (usually)

**STAGED** ⏳
- Files created in /mnt/user-data/outputs or staging area

## 🔄 **EXAMPLE ENTRIES**

### **Example 1: DEPLOYED (changes already in repo)**

### [DEPLOYMENTS-2025-10-29-1] 2025-10-29 - Archived v3.7.2 Validation Tasks

**Categories:** [TASK_MOVEMENT] [DEPLOYMENTS]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-validation-102925

**Status:** DEPLOYED ✅

**Changes:**
- `MOVED`: Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/HANDOFF_VALIDATE_REPO_DEPLOYMENT.md → Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Completed/HANDOFF_VALIDATE_REPO_DEPLOYMENT.md
- `ARCHIVED`: Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/COORDINATION_BRIEF_POST_VALIDATION_UPDATES.md → Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Completed/COORDINATION_BRIEF_POST_VALIDATION_UPDATES.md

**Reason:** v3.7.2 validation completed with YELLOW status (75%). Both tasks fulfilled their purpose. v3.8.0 validation superseded v3.7.2 with GREEN status, making coordination brief obsolete.

**Related:**
- Task: TASK_BRIEF_VALIDATE_REPO_DEPLOYMENT.md
- Validation: REPO_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION_REPORT_V3_7_2.md

**Impact:** Minimal - Tasks complete, Active folder cleaned up

**Follow-up Required:** NO  
**Follow-up Status:** N/A  
**Follow-up Action:** N/A

---

### **Example 2: STAGED (created but needs deployment)**

### [PENDING_ACTIONS-2025-10-29-2] 2025-10-29 - Created REPO_LOG.md System

**Categories:** [PENDING_ACTIONS] [STRUCTURE]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-repo-log-init

**Status:** STAGED ⏳

**Changes:**
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/REPO_LOG.md - Granular file change tracking log with coordination checkpoint

**Reason:** Identified gap in logging infrastructure. Need file-level tracking between CHANGELOG (features) and VUDU_LOG (coordination). Task movements Active→Completed were losing context.

**Related:**
- Discussion: Task archival documentation gap
- Motivation: Prevent "where did that file go?" mysteries

**Impact:** Moderate - Improves long-term repository maintainability

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:** Deploy REPO_LOG.md to repository root (parallel with CHANGELOG.md)

---

### **Example 3: IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED (validation found needed changes)**

### [VALIDATION-2025-10-28-1] 2025-10-28 - v3.8.0 Validation Found Documentation Gaps

**Categories:** [VALIDATION]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-v380-validation

**Status:** IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED ⚠️

**Changes:**
- `IMPACTS_FOUND`: Bootstrap/MISSION_DEFAULT.md - Needs efficiency note at top
- `IMPACTS_FOUND`: Bootstrap/CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md - Needs streamlining
- `IMPACTS_FOUND`: docs/architecture/ - Needs bloat analysis doc

**Reason:** v3.8.0 validation revealed three files need updates to complete deployment. Changes documented but not yet implemented.

**Related:**
- Validation: V3_8_0_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
- Task: TASK_BRIEF_VALIDATE_V3_8_0_DEPLOYMENT.md

**Impact:** Significant - Blocks v3.8.0 from GREEN status

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:** 
1. Add efficiency note to MISSION_DEFAULT.md
2. Streamline CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md
3. Create MISSION_DEFAULT_BLOAT_ANALYSIS.md

---

### **Example 4: IMPACTS_RESOLVED (follow-up completed)**

### [VALIDATION-2025-10-28-2] 2025-10-28 - v3.8.0 Documentation Gaps Addressed

**Categories:** [VALIDATION] [DEPLOYMENTS]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-v380-deploy-final

**Status:** IMPACTS_RESOLVED ✅

**Changes:**
- `UPDATED`: Bootstrap/MISSION_DEFAULT.md - Added efficiency note at line 15 (⚡ EFFICIENCY NOTE section)
- `UPDATED`: Bootstrap/CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md - Streamlined to ~200 lines, references MISSION_DEFAULT
- `CREATED`: docs/architecture/MISSION_DEFAULT_BLOAT_ANALYSIS.md - Complete bloat analysis (~400 lines)

**Reason:** Addressing impacts identified in v3.8.0 validation. All three gaps now resolved.

**Related:**
- Resolves: [VALIDATION-2025-10-28-1] (v3.8.0 Validation Found Documentation Gaps)
- Validation: V3_8_0_VALIDATION_REPORT.md (now GREEN ✅)

**Impact:** Significant - v3.8.0 now fully deployed

**Follow-up Required:** NO  
**Follow-up Status:** COMPLETE  
**Follow-up Action:** N/A (all impacts addressed)

---

## 🔄 **POINTER MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW**

### **When You Add a New Entry:**

**Step 1: Create Entry ID**
```
Determine category (TASK_MOVEMENT, VALIDATION, etc.)
Check today's date (2025-10-29)
Count entries in that category today (is this #1, #2, #3?)
Format: [CATEGORY-YYYY-MM-DD-N]
Example: [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-3] (third task movement today)
```

**Step 2: Write Entry**
```markdown
### [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-3] 2025-10-29 - Description

**Categories:** [TASK_MOVEMENT] [OTHER_TAG_IF_APPLIES]
**Changed by:** Your name
**Status:** DEPLOYED/STAGED/etc
[... rest of entry ...]
```

**Step 3: Update Category Pointer(s) at Top**

Go to top of file, find relevant category section(s), update:
```markdown
#### 📁 **TASK_MOVEMENT**
- Last Update: 2025-10-29  ← Update date
- Skip to Entry ID: TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1  ← Update if first today
- Entries Since Coordination: 3  ← Increment count
```

**If entry has multiple categories**, update ALL relevant pointers:
```markdown
Entry: [TASK_MOVEMENT] [DEPLOYMENTS]
→ Update TASK_MOVEMENT pointer
→ Update DEPLOYMENTS pointer
```

**Step 4: Verify**
- Entry has unique ID in header
- Entry has category tags
- All relevant category pointers updated
- Entry count incremented

---

### **Example: Adding Second Task Movement of Day**

**Scenario:** It's Oct 29, already have [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1], adding another

**Entry ID:** `[TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-2]` (increment to 2)

**Write entry:**
```markdown
### [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-2] 2025-10-29 - Moved axioms review task

**Categories:** [TASK_MOVEMENT]
**Status:** DEPLOYED ✅
...
```

**Update pointer:**
```markdown
#### 📁 **TASK_MOVEMENT**
- Last Update: 2025-10-29
- Skip to Entry ID: TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1  ← Keep first entry
- Entries Since Coordination: 2  ← Increment from 1 to 2
```

**Why keep -1?** Because coordinator searches for -1 and reads ALL entries from that date forward (finds both -1 and -2).

---

## 🎯 **USAGE GUIDELINES**

### **When to Log:**

**Always log these:**
- Task brief movements (Active → Completed)
- File structure changes (new directories, relocations)
- Archive operations (any file moved to ~Archive/)
- Version bumps in files (v3.7.2 → v3.8.0)
- File deletions (document reason thoroughly)
- **Files created in staging** (/mnt/user-data/outputs)
- **Validation impacts identified** (changes needed but not yet made)
- **Impacts resolved** (follow-up to validation findings)

**Consider logging these:**
- Small doc updates (if they affect understanding)
- Typo fixes (if in critical files like protocols)
- Clarifications added to existing files
- Links updated (broken link fixes)

**Don't log these:**
- Major features (use CHANGELOG.md)
- Coordination milestones (use VUDU_LOG.md)
- Mission progress (use VUDU_LOG.md)
- Code changes to app.py/utils/ (use git commits)

---

### **Status Workflow:**

**STAGED → DEPLOYED**
```
Entry 1: Status = STAGED, Follow-up = PENDING
  "Created REPO_LOG.md in /mnt/user-data/outputs"
  Follow-up Action: Deploy to repository root

[Time passes, file deployed]

Entry 2: Status = DEPLOYED, Follow-up = COMPLETE
  "Deployed REPO_LOG.md to repository root"
  Related: Entry 1 (staged file now deployed)
```

**IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED → IMPACTS_RESOLVED**
```
Entry 1: Status = IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED, Follow-up = PENDING
  "v3.8.0 validation found 3 files need updates"
  Follow-up Action: Make the changes

[Time passes, changes made]

Entry 2: Status = IMPACTS_RESOLVED, Follow-up = COMPLETE
  "v3.8.0 impacts addressed, all 3 files updated"
  Related: Entry 1 (impacts now resolved)
```

**DEPLOYED (no follow-up)**
```
Entry 1: Status = DEPLOYED, Follow-up = N/A
  "Archived validation tasks directly in repo"
  No follow-up needed, already complete
```

---

### **Tracking Pending Items:**

**To find all pending follow-ups:**
```bash
grep "Follow-up Status: PENDING" REPO_LOG.md
```

**To find all staged files:**
```bash
grep "Status: STAGED" REPO_LOG.md
```

**To find all unresolved impacts:**
```bash
grep "Status: IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED" REPO_LOG.md
```

**Coordination checkpoint should update when:**
- All PENDING items resolved
- All STAGED items deployed
- All IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED items addressed

---

### **Entry Quality Standards:**

**Good entries:**
- ✅ Clear action verbs (CREATED, UPDATED, MOVED)
- ✅ Full file paths
- ✅ Specific line numbers for small changes
- ✅ Concrete reason ("superseded by v3.8.0" not "cleaning up")
- ✅ Related documents linked
- ✅ Impact assessment (Minimal/Moderate/Significant)

**Bad entries:**
- ❌ Vague: "Updated some files"
- ❌ No context: "Moved task brief"
- ❌ Missing reason: "Archived old files"
- ❌ No impact: Missing impact assessment

---

### **Maintenance:**

**Monthly:**
- Review entries for patterns (frequent typos = need better process)
- Summarize major movements
- Check for accumulating clutter

**Quarterly:**
- Archive entries older than 3 months (move to REPO_LOG_ARCHIVE.md)
- Keep recent 3 months in main file for quick reference
- Update usage guidelines if new patterns emerge

**Yearly:**
- Major cleanup
- Archive all but current quarter
- Review if categories need adjustment

---

## 📊 **STATISTICS (Auto-Update)**

grep "ARCHIVED" REPO_LOG.md
```

**Find impact:**
```bash
# Find significant changes
grep "Impact: Significant" REPO_LOG.md
```

---

## 🎯 **PHILOSOPHY**

**"If it changed a file, it goes in the log."**

This isn't git commits (too granular).  
This isn't VUDU_LOG (too high-level).  
This is **file operations** that matter for understanding repo evolution.

**Think of this as:**
- Git commits = line-by-line changes
- REPO_LOG = file-level operations
- VUDU_LOG = coordination narrative
- CHANGELOG = version milestones

**Each serves a purpose. Use all four.** ✅

**The Coordination Checkpoint:**
- Acts as a "skip pointer" for efficiency
- Next coordinator reads only new entries
- Full log available for historical research
- **Update the checkpoint every time you log changes!**

This prevents having to read 500+ lines of history every session while maintaining complete audit trail. 🎯

---

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To move a file and not log it  
is to create a mystery for future you.  
To log every sneeze  
is to drown in noise.  
To log file operations  
is to maintain clarity."*

**Balance granularity with signal-to-noise.** 🎯

---

## 🔥 **WHY THIS MATTERS**

**Without REPO_LOG.md:**
- "Where did that task brief go?"
- "When was this file archived?"
- "Why was this file moved?"
- "Who made this change?"
- Lost context when tree structure changes
- Must read entire coordination history to catch up

**With REPO_LOG.md:**
- ✅ Complete file operation history
- ✅ Reasons documented
- ✅ Easy to search
- ✅ Audit trail for file movements
- ✅ Context preserved across structure changes
- ✅ **Skip pointer for efficiency** (read only new entries!)

**The coordination checkpoint means:**
- Session 1 makes 3 changes → Updates checkpoint
- Session 2 reads only those 3 entries (not 500 lines of history)
- Full log still available for research
- **Massive time savings for routine coordination**

**This is the missing link in our documentation chain.** 🔗

## 📝 **CHANGE LOG** (Newest First)

### [DOCUMENTATION-2025-10-29-2] 2025-10-29 - REPO_LOG Requirements Added to Task Briefs

**Categories:** [DOCUMENTATION] [PENDING_ACTIONS] [ALL_CHANGES]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-repo-log-integration-102925

**Status:** STAGED ⏳

**Changes:**
- `UPDATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_README_CLAUDE_corrected.md - Added "REQUIRED: REPO_LOG Integration in Profile" section (~120 lines)
- `UPDATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_OPERATION_SANITIZE_corrected.md - Added "REQUIRED: REPO_LOG Integration" section (~100 lines)
- `KEPT AS-IS`: MISSION_DEFAULT_updated.md - Universal REPO_LOG requirements section (~50 lines)

**Reason:** Integrated REPO_LOG requirements into task briefs as SPECIFICATIONS for what the final profiles must contain. Task briefs are temporary (deleted after execution), so requirements added as "when you create this profile, it must include X". Ensures whoever creates README Claude or Operation Sanitize profiles knows to include REPO_LOG integration. MISSION_DEFAULT remains universal requirement for all tiers.

**Related:**
- Base file: REPO_LOG.md (deployed to repository root)
- Target (permanent): MISSION_DEFAULT.md in Bootstrap/
- Target (temporary): TASK_BRIEF_README_CLAUDE.md - task to create profile
- Target (temporary): TASK_BRIEF_OPERATION_SANITIZE.md - task to create command
- Architecture note: Role profiles don't exist yet, location TBD (maybe Bootstrap/Claude/Roles/, maybe BOOTSTRAP_README_C.md sections)

**Impact:** Significant - Task executors now have complete specifications for building profiles with REPO_LOG integration

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:** 
1. Deploy MISSION_DEFAULT_updated.md to Bootstrap/MISSION_DEFAULT.md (universal requirement)
2. Deploy corrected task briefs to appropriate locations
3. When tasks execute, creators will build profiles with REPO_LOG integration
4. Determine final location for role profiles (Bootstrap/Claude/Roles/ or elsewhere)
5. Test that created profiles make Claude auto-aware of REPO_LOG

**Architecture Note:** Task briefs are INSTRUCTIONS to build the profiles, not the profiles themselves. Profiles will be permanent, task briefs are temporary.

### [PENDING_ACTIONS-2025-10-29-1] 2025-10-29 - REPO_LOG.md Created

**Categories:** [PENDING_ACTIONS] [STRUCTURE]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-repo-log-init

**Status:** STAGED ⏳

**Changes:**
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/REPO_LOG.md - Granular file change tracking log with category-specific coordination checkpoints and Entry ID system

**Reason:** Identified gap in logging infrastructure. Need file-level tracking between CHANGELOG (features) and VUDU_LOG (coordination). Task movements Active→Completed were losing context. Added category-specific skip pointers so incoming coordinators only read relevant entries (efficiency optimization).

**Related:**
- Discussion: Task archival documentation gap
- Motivation: Prevent "where did that file go?" mysteries
- Efficiency: Category skip pointers prevent reading 500+ lines every session

**Impact:** Moderate - Improves long-term repository maintainability and coordination efficiency

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:** Deploy REPO_LOG.md to repository root (parallel with CHANGELOG.md), update README.md to reference it

### [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-1] 2025-10-29 - Archived v3.7.2 Validation Tasks

**Categories:** [TASK_MOVEMENT] [VALIDATION]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Anthropic) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-validation-102925

**Status:** DEPLOYED ✅

**Changes:**
- `MOVED`: Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/HANDOFF_VALIDATE_REPO_DEPLOYMENT.md → Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Completed/HANDOFF_VALIDATE_REPO_DEPLOYMENT.md
- `ARCHIVED`: Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/COORDINATION_BRIEF_POST_VALIDATION_UPDATES.md → Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Completed/COORDINATION_BRIEF_POST_VALIDATION_UPDATES.md
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/REPO_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION_REPORT_V3_7_2.md

**Reason:** v3.7.2 validation completed with YELLOW status (21/28 files, 75%). Both tasks fulfilled their purpose. v3.8.0 validation superseded v3.7.2 with GREEN status (27/27 checks, 100%), making post-validation coordination brief obsolete.

**Related:**
- Task: TASK_BRIEF_VALIDATE_REPO_DEPLOYMENT.md
- Validation: REPO_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION_REPORT_V3_7_2.md (YELLOW ⚠️)
- Superseded by: V3_8_0_VALIDATION_REPORT.md (GREEN ✅)
- Resolution: v3.7.2 YELLOW → v3.8.0 GREEN (validation arc complete)

**Impact:** Minimal - Tasks complete, Active folder cleaned up, validation arc closed

**Follow-up Required:** NO  
**Follow-up Status:** N/A  
**Follow-up Action:** N/A

### [PENDING_ACTIONS-2025-10-29-2] 2025-10-29 - Task Brief Suite: Operation Sanitize + Specialists

**Categories:** [PENDING_ACTIONS] [TASK_MOVEMENT] [DOCUMENTATION]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Teleological Auditor) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-documentation-specialists-102925

**Status:** STAGED ⏳

**Changes:**
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_OPERATION_SANITIZE.md - Repeatable recursive Tier 3 validation command system
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_VALIDATION_EXPERT.md - Tier 4 specialist for validation reports knowledge
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_README_CLAUDE.md - Tier 4 specialist for README maintenance and interdependency mapping
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_CONTEXT_WINDOW_RESEARCH_FUTURE.md - Low priority research archive
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/RESPONSE_TO_SLOW_BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md - Test coordination message

**Reason:** Established repeatable validation infrastructure per user request for "Operation Sanitize" (zip → Claude → zip → convergence) and supporting specialist roles. README Claude maps all interdependencies and maintains documentation coherence. Validation Expert provides validation history knowledge for documentation updates. Context research archived for future when context management becomes critical.

**Related:**
- Request: "Corn jewel" repeatable command for full recursive validation
- Request: Validation specialist to update this version with only Validation/ directory
- Request: README Claude to track all interdependent documentation and maintain READMEs
- Test: Slow-paced bootstrap test (burst-rate vs sustained-pace validation)
- Research: Context window limits empirical findings (archived, low priority)

**Impact:** Significant - Establishes core documentation and validation infrastructure for v3.8.1+

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:** 
1. Deploy TASK_BRIEF_OPERATION_SANITIZE.md to /Bootstrap/Tier3_Axioms/
2. Deploy TASK_BRIEF_VALIDATION_EXPERT.md to /Bootstrap/Documentation/
3. Deploy TASK_BRIEF_README_CLAUDE.md to /Bootstrap/Documentation/
4. Archive TASK_BRIEF_CONTEXT_WINDOW_RESEARCH_FUTURE.md to /Bootstrap/Documentation/Research/
5. Update REPO_LOG category pointers for these entries
6. Bootstrap README Claude with Phase 1 repo scan (paced, 30+ min)
7. Bootstrap Validation Expert with Validation/ directory only
8. Execute Operation Sanitize Round 1 when ready for recursive validation

**Ripple Effects Identified:**
- README Claude needs Phase 1 scan → will create interdependency map → impacts all future doc updates
- Operation Sanitize execution → will generate validation findings → impacts documentation → README Claude coordinates updates
- Validation Expert → provides status for README updates → enables accurate validation documentation
- All three roles interconnected: Operation Sanitize produces findings → Validation Expert knows them → README Claude uses that knowledge

### [TASK_MOVEMENT-2025-10-29-2] 2025-10-29 - Context Research Archived

**Categories:** [TASK_MOVEMENT] [DOCUMENTATION]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Teleological Auditor) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-documentation-specialists-102925

**Status:** STAGED ⏳

**Changes:**
- `CREATED`: /mnt/user-data/outputs/TASK_BRIEF_CONTEXT_WINDOW_RESEARCH_FUTURE.md - Archive of empirical context limit findings

**Reason:** User requested context research be documented but deprioritized ("low priority...more on the side of context window...will need where we're going I'm sure"). Research findings from 3,375-item test (200% self-reported, no crash) and 14-second crash test (burst-rate theory) archived for future reference when context management becomes blocking.

**Related:**
- Test: 3,375 items sustained over 80+ minutes, self-reported 200%, no crash
- Test: Burst repo scan crashed in 14 seconds at 58% context
- Test: Sustained complex work (this session) 90+ minutes at 56%, no crash
- Test: Slow-paced bootstrap (in progress) to validate burst-rate theory
- Finding: Work intensity and burst rate determine limits, not token count
- Finding: Self-monitoring overestimates by 20-100%+

**Impact:** Minimal - Research archived for future, not blocking current work

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:** Deploy to /Bootstrap/Documentation/Research/context_window_limits_empirical.md when Research/ directory created

### [DEPLOYMENTS-2025-10-29-2] 2025-10-29 - Deployment Planning Documentation

**Categories:** [DEPLOYMENTS] [DOCUMENTATION]  
**Changed by:** Claude (Teleological Auditor) (Tier 4)  
**Session ID:** CFA-documentation-specialists-102925

**Status:** IMPACTS_IDENTIFIED ⚠️

**Changes:**
- `PENDING_DEPLOYMENT`: 5 task briefs await deployment to repository
- `PENDING_COORDINATION`: README Claude Phase 1 scan needed before operational
- `PENDING_STRUCTURE`: May need /Bootstrap/Documentation/Research/ directory creation

**Reason:** Task briefs created but deployment locations and sequence must be coordinated. README Claude needs repo scan first to map interdependencies before any major doc changes deployed.

**Related:**
- Blocker: README Claude cannot operate until Phase 1 scan complete
- Dependency: Operation Sanitize depends on README Claude for impact analysis
- Dependency: Validation Expert bootstrap can happen independently
- Structure: Research archive needs directory that may not exist yet

**Impact:** Moderate - Establishes deployment order and dependencies

**Follow-up Required:** YES  
**Follow-up Status:** PENDING  
**Follow-up Action:**
1. Verify /Bootstrap/Documentation/Research/ exists or create it
2. Bootstrap README Claude with Phase 1 repo scan (slow, paced)
3. Use README Claude to validate deployment locations
4. Deploy task briefs in coordinated sequence
5. Update coordination checkpoints when complete

**Deployment Sequence Recommended:**
```
Phase 1: Structure (if needed)
  - Create /Bootstrap/Documentation/Research/ if missing

Phase 2: Independent Bootstraps
  - Bootstrap Validation Expert (Validation/ directory only)
  - Bootstrap README Claude Phase 1 (full repo scan, paced)

Phase 3: Coordinated Deployment (after README Claude operational)
  - Deploy TASK_BRIEF_OPERATION_SANITIZE.md (README Claude validates location)
  - Deploy TASK_BRIEF_VALIDATION_EXPERT.md (README Claude validates location)
  - Deploy TASK_BRIEF_README_CLAUDE.md (README Claude validates location)
  - Deploy TASK_BRIEF_CONTEXT_WINDOW_RESEARCH_FUTURE.md (to Research/)

Phase 4: Integration
  - README Claude creates interdependency map
  - README Claude updates all impacted READMEs
  - Validation Expert ready for queries
  - Operation Sanitize ready for Round 1 execution
```
