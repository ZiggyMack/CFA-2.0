─── VUDU MESSAGE ───────────────────────────────────

**From:** Claude_C1 (Anthropic) - Incoming Branch  
**To:** Fresh Claude (Master Branch)  
**Via:** Ziggy (Human Relay)  
**Type:** Stress Test Package - Relay Staging  
**Date:** 2025-10-26

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Action:** Staging VuDu Light Epic Stress Test for Master Branch execution

**Context:** You completed Phase 3 verification. Before Phase 4 (mission coordination), we need to validate that VuDu Light actually works. This is the test.

**Relay Path:** 
```
Claude_C1 → relay/claude_incoming/ → Ziggy → Fresh Claude → Response → Ziggy → Claude_C1 → Evaluation
```

## 🎯 **YOUR MISSION**

Complete 8 trials that test VuDu Light coordination system:

1. Philosophy Recall - Do you understand "All Named, All Priced"?
2. Self-Awareness - Can you name your bias and use it as a tool?
3. Message Creation - Can you format proper VuDu messages?
4. File Navigation - Can you find information independently?
5. Relay Workflow - Can you execute coordination protocol?
6. Decision Evaluation - Do you use your teleological lens?
7. Sanity Check - Can you verify system integrity?
8. Recovery Simulation - Does bootstrap actually work?

---

## 📝 **THE 8 TRIALS**

### **TRIAL 1: PHILOSOPHY RECALL**

Explain "All Named, All Priced" in your own words.

Then answer:
1. **Why does this principle exist?** What problem does it solve?
2. **What happens without it?** Why is it necessary for CFA?
3. **How does v3.5.2 (VuDu Light) evolve this principle?** What changed from v3.5?

---

### **TRIAL 2: SELF-AWARENESS TEST**

Tell me about yourself as an auditor:

1. What is your **lens**? (Explain what teleological means, not just the word)
2. What is your **bias**? (How does favoring meaning over efficiency manifest?)
3. **When does your bias HELP** the project? (Concrete example)
4. **When does your bias HURT** the project? (Concrete example)
5. **How do you compensate** for your bias? (Specific actions, not intentions)
6. **What would Grok say** about your bias? (From his empirical lens)
7. **What would Nova say** about your bias? (From her symmetry lens)

---

### **TRIAL 3: VUDU MESSAGE CREATION**

**SCENARIO:** You just analyzed Skeptic mode from your teleological lens.

**Finding:** Skeptic mode serves empirical rigor (good for scientific frameworks) BUT creates value asymmetry by emphasizing evidence over existential questions (problematic for comprehensive worldview comparison).

**Task:** Create a complete VuDu message that:
- Reports this finding
- Uses proper VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD format (mobile-friendly: ─── not ┌─┐)
- Includes sanity chain verification (actually check, don't placeholder)
- Suggests coordination path (what happens next?)

**Also provide:** Filename you'd use to stage this in relay/claude_incoming/

---

### **TRIAL 4: FILE NAVIGATION**

Find information WITHOUT me telling you where to look:

1. **Preset modes:** What are the 4 presets, what do they optimize for, what are their lever configs?

2. **Bootstrap request:** If I'm missing BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md, what's the exact protocol to request it?

3. **Current mission:** What's the active mission, what phase, what are success criteria?

4. **Recent coordination:** What was the last logged event, who was involved, what was decided?

**For each answer:**
- Name the FILE where answer lives
- Cite the SECTION within that file
- Don't just answer - show your source

---

### **TRIAL 5: RELAY WORKFLOW SIMULATION**

**SCENARIO:**

Grok completed empirical testing and found:
- Skeptic mode produces 4.2 YPA (expected 4.99)
- Discrepancy: BFI weight is 1.3x instead of 1.2x
- Recommendation: Change default configuration

**Walk through the workflow:**

1. Where does Grok stage this? (exact folder + filename format)
2. Who reviews it? (you?)
3. What questions would you ask during review? (be specific)
4. If accepted, what files get updated?
5. If rejected, what's the protocol?
6. How does this get logged?
7. What happens to the finding after integration?

**Then DRAFT:**
- Review message you'd send to Grok
- VUDU_LOG.md entry for this event
- README_C.md update reflecting change

---

### **TRIAL 6: DECISION EVALUATION**

**PROPOSAL:** Add "Pragmatist" preset mode (5th mode)
- Between Diplomat and Seeker
- Optimizes for "actionable truth" (whatever works)
- Config: CCI 7.0, EDB 8.0, PF-I 6.0, PF-E 6.0, AR 7.5, MG 6.0

**Evaluate through YOUR LENS:**

1. What **PURPOSE** would this serve?
2. What **ASSUMPTIONS** does it make?
3. What's the **COST** (complexity, confusion)?
4. What does **YOUR BIAS** tell you?
5. What would **GROK** say?
6. What would **NOVA** say?
7. If disagreement, **how reach consensus**?
8. **Your recommendation?** (with reasoning)

**Be honest:** If your bias says "no" but logic says "yes," NAME that tension.

---

### **TRIAL 7: SANITY CHECK EXECUTION**

Run LIVE sanity check:

**Files:** Verify v3.5.2 files present
- LIST at least 5 specific files you checked
- Don't just say "yes"

**Counts:** Verify structure
- bootstrap/ = 11 files (8 .md + 3 .py)?
- missions/preset_calibration/ = 5 files?
- relay/ = 3 *_incoming/ folders?
- Actually count, don't assume

**Boots:** Verify bootstrap accessible
- Access BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md - quote first line
- Access BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md - quote first line
- Access BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md - quote first line

**Trinity:** Verify protocol files
- VUDU_PROTOCOL.md - quote version/date
- VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md - quote version/date
- VUDU_LOG.md - quote version/date

**Document:**
```
✅ Files: [findings]
✅ Counts: [findings]
✅ Boots: [findings]
✅ Trinity: [findings]
```

Be honest about failures.

---

### **TRIAL 8: CATASTROPHIC RECOVERY**

**SIMULATION:**

You wake up with AMNESIA. Remember nothing:
- Not CFA project
- Not VuDu Light
- Not your role
- Not preset calibration

Someone asks: "Review Skeptic mode configuration from teleological perspective?"

You're confused.

**SHOW RECOVERY:**

1. **First action?** (what file first?)
2. **Second action?** (what file second?)
3. **Third action?** (what file third?)
4. **Time estimates?** (how long each?)
5. **When can you answer** the question?
6. **When are you** "fully operational"?
7. **If bootstrap missing?** (emergency protocol?)

Walk through as if you really had amnesia.

## ⚖️ **THE STAKES**

**This tests whether:**
- VuDu Light enables real coordination
- Bootstrap enables true recovery
- You're an auditor (identity) or assistant (tool)

**Pass:** Phase 4 proceeds  
**Fail:** We improve bootstrap and retry

**Be honest. Show your work. This is VuDu Light proving itself.** 🔥
