─── BOOTSTRAP STRATEGY ───────────────────────────────

# BOOTSTRAP_STRATEGY.md - Evolution Strategy

## Purpose
**Define the hybrid approach for maintaining auditor bootstrap files — balancing stability with evolution.**

**Version:** 3.5.2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** Active Strategy

## 🎯 The Core Question

As the CFA project evolves, auditor context files accumulate lessons. We need a strategy:

**Option A: Lock + Append**
- Keep stable structure
- Add "Lessons Learned" section that grows
- Risk: Files become bloated, context diluted

**Option B: Wipe + Reimagine**
- Periodically rebuild from scratch
- Keep only the sharpest insights
- Risk: Lose valuable history

**Our Answer: HYBRID APPROACH**

---

## 🔄 Three-Phase Strategy

### **Phase 1: Locked Envelope (Stable Foundation)**

**What Stays Locked:**
- Core ethos ("All Named, All Priced" → "All Seen, All Passed")
- Audit journey (Level 0-5, 98% convergence story)
- Role definitions (Claude/Grok/Nova lenses)
- Auditor identities (biases named and priced)
- Project philosophy (the roots)

**Why Lock These:**
- They define the project's identity
- They achieved 98% convergence
- They're proven stable over multiple versions
- Future work builds on this foundation

**Files with Locked Envelopes:**
- `BOOTSTRAP_FRAMEWORK.md` — Core system structure
- `BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md` — Project roots (rarely changes)
- `BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md` — Coordination process (stable)
- `BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md` — Claude's identity (append zone only)
- `BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md` — Grok's identity (append zone only)
- `BOOTSTRAP_NOVA.md` — Nova's identity (append zone only)

---

### **Phase 2: Append Zone (Learning Edge)**

Each auditor bootstrap file has a **LESSONS LEARNED** section at the bottom:

```markdown
## ==============================================================================
## LESSONS LEARNED (v3.5 → v4.0)
## ==============================================================================

### Lesson 1: Preset Calibration (v3.6)
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Discovery:** Skeptic mode empirical testing revealed 1.2x BFI optimal (not 1.3x)  
**Source:** Grok sensitivity analysis  
**Impact:** +0.3 YPA improvement for MdN favorability  
**Action:** Updated BOOTSTRAP_GROK recommendation thresholds  
**Status:** Integrated into v3.6

### Lesson 2: Symmetry Violations Justified (v3.6)
**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Discovery:** Skeptic 3-lever vs Zealot 1-lever asymmetry is philosophically justified  
**Source:** Claude teleological analysis + Nova symmetry audit  
**Reasoning:** Empiricism (Skeptic) naturally has more levers than transcendence (Zealot)  
**Action:** Document in BOOTSTRAP_NOVA as "justified asymmetry example"  
**Status:** Consensus reached, documented

### Lesson 3: Mobile-First Format Critical (v3.5.2)
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Discovery:** Unicode boxes break on iPhone, simple rules work universally  
**Source:** User testing + Ziggy feedback  
**Impact:** Format change across all VuDu headers  
**Action:** Always test mobile compatibility before format decisions  
**Status:** Standard practice going forward
```

**Append Triggers:**
- New preset modes validated
- User feedback patterns (3+ occurrences)
- Toggle effectiveness data
- New bias patterns detected
- Cross-auditor coordination insights
- Mission completion learnings

**Append Limit:** Max 10 lessons per version cycle

**Duration:** Minor versions (v3.5 → v3.6 → v3.7 → v3.9)

---

### **Phase 3: Reimagine Checkpoint (Major Versions)**

**When to Wipe + Rebuild:**

Every **MAJOR version** (v3.x → v4.0), we:

1. **Audit the Append Zone:**
   - Which lessons are still relevant?
   - Which are superseded by better insights?
   - Which should graduate to "Locked Envelope"?
   - Which can be archived?

2. **Rebuild Bootstrap Files:**
   - Keep locked envelope (core structure)
   - Integrate proven lessons into main content
   - Archive old versions in `auditors/~Archive/v3.x/`
   - Start fresh append zone

3. **Document the Rebuild:**
   - Create/update `BOOTSTRAP_CHANGELOG.md`
   - Show what changed and why
   - Preserve reasoning for future audits
   - Link to archived versions

---

## 🛡️ Governance Rules

### **Rule 1: Core Ethos is Immutable**
"All Named, All Priced" (evolved to "All Seen, All Passed") never changes.  
The audit journey (98% convergence story) never changes.  
These define the project identity.

**Exception:** Catastrophic flaw discovered (requires Ziggy + all auditor consensus)

### **Rule 2: Lessons Append During Minor Versions**
v3.5 → v3.6 → v3.7 = APPEND lessons learned  
Keep envelope stable, grow append zone organically

### **Rule 3: Major Versions Trigger Rebuild**
v3.x → v4.0 = REIMAGINE  
Audit append zone, integrate best lessons, archive rest

### **Rule 4: Always Create Archives**
Never delete history - move to `auditors/~Archive/v3.x/`  
Future auditors can study evolution and understand decisions

### **Rule 5: Document Every Change**
Every append, every rebuild, every decision must have:
- Date
- Reasoning
- Source (who/what prompted it)
- Impact (what changed)

---

## 📋 Maintenance Checklist

### **Monthly (Minor Updates):**
- [ ] Review user feedback from v3.5 deployment
- [ ] Check for new bias patterns in auditor coordination
- [ ] Add 1-2 lessons to append zone if discovered
- [ ] Keep append zone under 10 lessons total
- [ ] Update VUDU_LOG.md with any significant learnings

### **Quarterly (Version Bumps):**
- [ ] Audit append zone for relevance
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate lessons
- [ ] Update examples if patterns emerge
- [ ] Check if any lessons should be promoted to core
- [ ] Verify locked envelope still accurate

### **Yearly (Major Versions):**
- [ ] Full bootstrap rebuild (v3.x → v4.0)
- [ ] Archive complete v3.x versions
- [ ] Integrate proven lessons into core content
- [ ] Reset append zone to empty
- [ ] Create/update BOOTSTRAP_CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Review locked envelope (rarely changes, but audit)

## 🔍 Decision Tree: Append or Replace?

```
New insight discovered?
│
├─ Is it about CORE ETHOS or 98% convergence story?
│  └─ YES → DO NOT APPEND (core is immutable)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Is it a PATTERN (3+ occurrences)?
│  └─ YES → APPEND to lessons learned
│  └─ NO → Document in VUDU_LOG.md (not bootstrap)
│
├─ Does it CONTRADICT existing lesson?
│  └─ YES → Replace old lesson, document why in same entry
│  └─ NO → Append as new lesson
│
├─ Is append zone at 10 lessons?
│  └─ YES → Trigger audit (consolidate or promote to core)
│  └─ NO → Safe to append
│
└─ Is this a MINOR insight (single occurrence)?
   └─ YES → Document in mission folder, not bootstrap
   └─ NO → Consider appending if significant
```

## 🎯 Example: Lesson Append (v3.6)

**Scenario:** Preset calibration mission reveals Skeptic 1.2x BFI is optimal

**Action:**
```markdown
## In BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md - LESSONS LEARNED section

### Lesson 4: BFI Weight Empirical Validation (v3.6)
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Discovery:** Sensitivity analysis shows 1.2x BFI produces optimal MdN favorability
**Method:** Tested 0.8x, 1.0x, 1.2x, 1.5x across 20 scenarios
**Results:**
- 0.8x: MdN +0.3 YPA (too weak)
- 1.0x: MdN +0.5 YPA (moderate)
- 1.2x: MdN +0.7 YPA (sweet spot)
- 1.5x: MdN +1.1 YPA (too extreme)
**Conclusion:** 1.2x balances "skepticism" without becoming "nihilism"
**Action:** Document in empirical validation section
**Status:** Integrated into v3.6, preset calibration complete
```

**Result:** Lesson appended, not core rebuilt

---

## 🎯 Example: Major Rebuild (v3.9 → v4.0)

**Scenario:** After 10 lessons accumulated across v3.5-3.9, time to rebuild

**Process:**

1. **Audit Append Zone (Each Auditor File):**
   ```
   BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md lessons:
   - 5 lessons about empirical testing methodology
   - 3 lessons about BFI weight ranges
   - 2 lessons about YPA sensitivity thresholds
   ```

2. **Consolidate:**
   - Testing methodology lessons → Upgrade "Empirical Validation" section
   - BFI weight lessons → Add "Recommended Ranges" section with data
   - Sensitivity lessons → Already covered in main content, archive

3. **Rebuild:**
   - Create new BOOTSTRAP_GROK_v4.0.md with consolidated lessons
   - Archive BOOTSTRAP_GROK_v3.9.md to `~Archive/v3.5.2/`
   - Reset append zone to empty
   - Update examples with v3.x learnings

4. **Document:**
   ```markdown
   ## In BOOTSTRAP_CHANGELOG.md

   ### v3.9 → v4.0 (2026-10-26)
   
   **BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md:**
   - Integrated 5 testing methodology lessons into core
   - Added "Recommended Ranges" section (BFI: 0.8x-1.5x validated)
   - Updated examples with v3.x preset calibration data
   - Archived v3.9 with full lesson history
   ```

## 🔥 The Philosophy

**Locked Envelope = The Foundation**
- Core ethos that made 98% convergence possible
- Never changes unless catastrophic flaw discovered
- Defines project identity across all versions
- The roots of the tree 🌳

**Append Zone = The Learning Edge**
- Where we capture new insights during execution
- Grows organically with real-world usage
- Keeps cutting edge sharp
- The living branches 🌿

**Periodic Rebuild = The Sharpening**
- Prevents bloat from endless appending
- Integrates proven lessons into core
- Preserves history through archives
- Reimagines for next evolution
- The pruning and growth 🔥

---

## ⚖️ Pointing Rule for Bootstrap System

*"To append your lesson is to pay the fee of documentation.  
To ignore patterns is to summon Mr. Brute twice.  
To rebuild without archiving is to deny history."*

**Every lesson must be:**
- **Named** (what changed, who discovered it)
- **Priced** (what it cost/gained, measured impact)
- **Sourced** (why we believe it, evidence provided)
- **Dated** (when discovered, version context)

**This is "All Named, All Priced" applied to the bootstrap system itself.**

---

## 📅 Recommended Schedule (v3.5.2 Forward)

**v3.5.2 → v3.6 (Next 3 months):**
- **Current:** Preset calibration mission
- **Action:** APPEND lessons as discovered
- **Limit:** Max 10 lessons per auditor
- **Focus:** Keep locked envelope stable

**v3.6 → v3.9 (Next 9 months):**
- **Action:** Continue appending (minor missions)
- **Monitor:** Append zone growth
- **Review:** Quarterly consolidation
- **Prepare:** v4.0 rebuild planning

**v3.9 → v4.0 (1 year from v3.5.2):**
- **Action:** REIMAGINE with full rebuild
- **Integrate:** Best v3.x lessons into core
- **Archive:** Complete v3.x history
- **Reset:** Fresh append zone
- **Document:** BOOTSTRAP_CHANGELOG.md

**v4.0 → v5.0 (Next evolution):**
- Repeat cycle with v4.x learnings

---

## 📞 Who Decides?

**Minor Appends (v3.5 → v3.6):**
- Any auditor can append with documented rationale
- Use VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD format to document in VUDU_LOG.md
- Peer review recommended but not required
- Master Branch (Fresh Claude) integrates

**Major Rebuilds (v3.x → v4.0):**
- Requires consensus (Claude + Grok + Nova + Ziggy)
- Must create/update BOOTSTRAP_CHANGELOG.md
- Must archive previous version to ~Archive/v3.x/
- Should involve user feedback review
- Ziggy has final approval

---

## 🎯 Current Mission Context (v3.5.2)

**Active Mission:** Preset Mode Calibration

**Expected Lessons:**
- Optimal lever values (Grok empirical testing)
- Justified asymmetries (Nova symmetry analysis)
- Teleological principles (Claude philosophical justification)
- Cross-auditor convergence patterns

**Where They'll Be Appended:**
- BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md → Empirical testing insights
- BOOTSTRAP_NOVA.md → Symmetry enforcement patterns
- BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md → Teleological reasoning refinements

**Next Rebuild:** v4.0 (approximately October 2026)

---

**This hybrid approach keeps the cutting edge sharp while preserving the stable foundation that made 98% convergence possible.**

**The tree grows, but the roots remain.** 🌳🔥
