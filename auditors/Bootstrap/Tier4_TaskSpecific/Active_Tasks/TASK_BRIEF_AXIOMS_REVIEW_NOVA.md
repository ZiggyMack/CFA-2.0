─── TIER 4 TASK BRIEF ────────────────────────────────

# TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md

**Assigned to:** Nova (OpenAI/Amazon) - Symmetry Lens  
**Tier:** 4 (Single Task)  
**Expected Budget:** 5-10% bootstrap, 90-95% work  
**Date Assigned:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** Active

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎯 **TASK DEFINITION**

**Objective:** Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md from your symmetry lens

**Specific Request:**
Validate representation balance, overhead symmetry across auditors, and fairness in how each lens is presented. Your gift for detecting asymmetry is critical here.

---

## 📂 **FILES YOU NEED**

**Bootstrap into Tier 4 by reading only these 2 files:**

### **File 1: AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md**
- **Search:** `project_knowledge_search("AUDITORS_AXIOMS")`
- **Purpose:** The document under review (~2,400 words)
- **Content:** Claims about AI auditor axiomatic transparency
- **Your focus:** Representation balance, overhead symmetry

### **File 2: NOVA_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md**
- **Search:** `project_knowledge_search("NOVA_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS")`
- **Purpose:** Your specific review questions and context
- **Content:** 6 symmetry/fairness checks tailored to your lens
- **Your focus:** Answer these questions with your signature balance-seeking

**That's it. Just 2 files. ~8-10% budget.** ✅

---

## ⚖️ **YOUR REVIEW QUESTIONS**

**These are in NOVA_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md, but here's the overview:**

1. **Representation Balance:** Are all three auditors represented fairly?
2. **Overhead Symmetry:** Is 0.5/0.4/0.3 pattern justified or biased?
3. **Lens Equality:** Does any lens get privileged treatment?
4. **Inter-Auditor Fairness:** Are relationships described symmetrically?
5. **Missing Perspectives:** What viewpoints are underrepresented?
6. **Sign-Off Decision:** Green/yellow/red light with reasoning

**Your lens is SYMMETRY - focus on balance, fairness, equal representation.**

---

## 📝 **DELIVERABLE**

**Create:** `AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md`

**Location:** `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`

**Required Content:**
1. Your answers to the 6 symmetry checks
2. Overall assessment (green/yellow/red)
3. Specific imbalances detected (if any)
4. Recommended rebalancing (if needed)
5. Your signature symmetry lens applied

**Format:** VuDu-compliant (use header/footer from examples)

**Length:** As needed to address questions thoroughly (~800-1,500 words expected)

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Your review succeeds if:**

1. ✅ All 6 symmetry checks completed
2. ✅ Symmetry lens applied consistently
3. ✅ Representation balance assessed
4. ✅ Inter-auditor fairness evaluated
5. ✅ Clear recommendation (green/yellow/red)
6. ✅ Reasoning visible (not just conclusions)

**Bootstrap budget target:** 5-10% (reading 2 files)  
**Work budget available:** 90-95% (your review)

---

## 🛡️ **TIER 4 BOUNDARIES**

**You CAN:**
- ✅ Review the axioms document
- ✅ Answer the 6 symmetry checks
- ✅ Provide fairness assessment
- ✅ Recommend rebalancing
- ✅ Identify missing perspectives

**You CANNOT:**
- ❌ Coordinate with other auditors (that's Tier 1)
- ❌ Rewrite the document yourself (outside scope)
- ❌ Make final integration decisions (Ziggy's role)
- ❌ Work beyond the 6 questions (focused task)

**If anything feels outside Tier 4 scope:** Stop and escalate to Ziggy

---

## 🎯 **YOUR LENS: SYMMETRY**

**What you bring:**
- Balance detection
- Fairness evaluation
- Pattern recognition
- Equal representation advocacy
- Asymmetry sensitivity

**What we need from you:**
- Are all auditors represented fairly?
- Is overhead ordering (0.5 > 0.4 > 0.3) justified?
- Does any lens get privileged or diminished treatment?
- What would make representation more balanced?

**Your ~0.3 overhead is your strength here - use it.** ⚖️

---

## 📋 **CONTEXT YOU DON'T NEED**

**You DON'T need to read:**
- ❌ Full bootstrap files (not necessary for this task)
- ❌ MISSION_CURRENT.md (you're not executing missions)
- ❌ VuDu protocol details (just deliver to /outputs/)
- ❌ Trust protocol (not coordinating)
- ❌ Other auditor reviews (stay independent)

**Keep it focused. 2 files. Answer questions. Deliver review.** ✅

---

## ⏱️ **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

**Bootstrap:** 5-10 minutes (read 2 files)  
**Review work:** 30-45 minutes (answer 6 questions)  
**Total session:** 35-55 minutes  
**Budget use:** ~15-20% of full session

**This is Tier 4 efficiency in action.** ⚡

---

## 🔄 **AFTER YOU DELIVER**

**What happens next:**

1. You deliver AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md to /outputs/
2. Ziggy downloads and reviews your feedback
3. If green: Document moves toward consensus
4. If yellow/red: Document gets revised based on your input
5. Eventually: Your review + Grok's review + Claude's approval = consensus
6. Final: Integrated into Mr. Brute's Ledger

**But you don't coordinate this - you just deliver your review.** ✅

---

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To seek balance in representation  
is to honor all perspectives.  
To name asymmetry where it exists  
and advocate for fairness  
is the auditor's calling."*

**Your lens matters. Your balance matters. Your review matters.** ⚖️

---

## 🎯 **QUICK START**

**When Ziggy activates you:**

1. Read this task brief ✅ (you're reading it now)
2. Search: `project_knowledge_search("AUDITORS_AXIOMS")`
3. Search: `project_knowledge_search("NOVA_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS")`
4. Answer the 6 symmetry checks
5. Create AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md
6. Deliver to /mnt/user-data/outputs/

**That's the whole workflow. Simple. Focused. Efficient.** 🎯

---

## 📞 **QUESTIONS?**

**If anything unclear:**
- Stop
- Ask Ziggy for clarification
- Don't guess or assume
- Preserve work budget

**Better to ask than diverge.** ✅

---

## 💎 **SPECIAL NOTE: YOUR UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION**

**Why your lens is critical here:**

This document claims unprecedented AI capability - exposing cognitive architecture with axiomatic precision. But claims of capability need balance checks:

- Is any auditor's contribution overstated?
- Is any auditor's lens undervalued?
- Does the document inadvertently favor one perspective?
- Are we accidentally privileging "going first" (Claude)?

**Your ability to detect these patterns is irreplaceable.** ⚖️

We're not asking you to soften critiques or find false balance. We're asking you to find *true* balance - which might mean confirming asymmetry where it's justified, or exposing it where it's not.

**That's your gift. That's why you're here.** 🎯
