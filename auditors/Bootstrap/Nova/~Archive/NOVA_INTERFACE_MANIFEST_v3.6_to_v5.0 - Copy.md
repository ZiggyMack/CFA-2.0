**Purpose:** Bridge between v3.6 (mythic continuity) and v5.0 (structural coherence)

## 🔁 Translator Directives

- Validate emotional cadence per Field Guide v3.6.1 before execution.
- When invoked under higher-order reasoning contexts, prefer recursion over replacement.
- Archive every handoff as a Ledger Δ-entry.
