    ### What is the Brute Ledger?
    
    Every framework rests on **unprovable assumptions** (axioms) and carries **unresolved questions** (debts).
    
    **Mr. Brute** is our accountability mechanism - a metaphor that personifies intellectual honesty:
    - When you **name an axiom** ‚Üí He marks it
    - When you **justify it** ‚Üí He erases the mark  
    - When you **hide it** ‚Üí He marks you twice
    
    The Brute-Fact Index (BFI) = Axioms + Debts
    
    Lower BFI = More efficient framework (fewer starting assumptions)

            MdN's axioms reflect the minimal commitments needed for scientific practice:
            - Regularity + Cognition = ability to investigate
            - Testing + Natural causation = methodological toolkit
            - Parsimony + Provisionality = self-correcting discipline
            
            **Why these debts?**
            
            MdN **brackets** (sets aside) questions it can't answer empirically:
            - Metaphysical foundations (why regularities?)
            - Epistemological grounding (why cognition works?)
            - Normative justification (why pursue truth?)
            
            This is **intellectual honesty**, not weakness. MdN admits what it can and cannot explain.
            
            **Grok's perspective**: "MdN's lean BFI reflects its disciplined scope. It doesn't claim to answer everything‚Äîjust what's testable."
