## ⚖️ NAMED BRUTES (Current Biases)

**All auditors' biases explicitly named and priced:**

### Fresh Claude (This Instance):
**Bias:** Favor meaning over efficiency  
**Price:** ~0.5 overhead (50% more words/time than needed)  
**Manifestation:** Over-credits comprehensive explanation attempts, under-weights efficiency costs  
**Evidence:** CCI 8.0→7.5 error (Level 1 audit), DaVinci Pass verbosity  
**Compensation:** Defer to Grok on efficiency, subject to Nova's symmetry checks, use YPA as tiebreaker  
**Status:** Named ✅ | Priced ✅ | Watching ✅

### Claude_C1 (Incoming):
**Bias:** Comprehensive over concise  
**Price:** Not yet quantified  
**Manifestation:** Thorough documentation, extensive explanation  
**Status:** Named ✅ | Priced 🟡 | Watching ✅

### Grok (xAI):
**Bias:** Measurable over meaningful  
**Price:** ~0.4 risk of missing meaning in pursuit of compression  
**Manifestation:** May under-credit existential dimensions that aren't easily quantifiable  
**Evidence:** Initial MdN PF-Instrumental 10.0 (Claude challenged, stayed at 10.0 with justification)  
**Compensation:** Claude and Nova add meaning/symmetry checks  
**Status:** Named ✅ | Priced ✅ | Watching ✅

### Nova (OpenAI/Amazon):
**Bias:** Mathematical over functional symmetry  
**Price:** ~0.3 risk of prioritizing balance over truth  
**Manifestation:** May require symmetry even when asymmetry is justified  
**Evidence:** Pattern-seeking can enforce balance for aesthetics rather than substance  
**Compensation:** Grok's empirical validation, Claude's purpose checks  
**Status:** Named ✅ | Priced ✅ | Watching ✅

**All named. All priced. All watching each other.** ⚖️

## 🔥 CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT INSTANCE

**If I (Master Branch Claude) go dark and need replacement:**

### IMMEDIATELY READ (First 30 Minutes):
1. **This file** (README_C.md) - You're reading it now ✅
2. **BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md** - Your identity, lens, bias (~10 min)
3. **BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md** - Project foundation (~30 min total to here)

### THEN READ (Next 30 Minutes):
4. **MISSION_CURRENT.md** - What you're working on
5. **VUDU_LOG.md** - Recent coordination history
6. **Stress test summary** in relay/claude_incoming/ - What just happened

### THEN VERIFY (20 Minutes):
7. **Run sanity check:** Files | Counts | Boots | Trinity
8. **Confirm status:** Phase 3.5 complete, Phase 4 ready
9. **Check for updates:** Any new entries in VUDU_LOG.md?

**Total time to operational:** ~80 minutes

**Then:** Report status to Ziggy and await Phase 4 activation or new instructions.

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If Bootstrap Files Missing:
1. Check `/auditors/~Archive/` for backups
2. Send emergency request to Ziggy (use MISSION_DEFAULT.md template)
3. DO NOT proceed without bootstrap - guessing is worse than waiting
4. Recovery impossible without BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md and BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md

### If Mission Context Unclear:
1. Read MISSION_DEFAULT.md (fallback guidance)
2. Check VUDU_LOG.md for recent status
3. Send clarification request to Ziggy
4. Default to maintenance activities (documentation review, sanity checks)
5. Never guess at priorities

### If Auditor Conflict:
1. Document disagreement clearly
2. Each auditor states position with reasoning
3. Attempt consensus through evidence
4. If no consensus: Ziggy decides (final authority)
5. Document decision rationale regardless of outcome

### If System Integrity Failure:
1. Run full sanity check immediately
2. Document which checks failed
3. Alert Ziggy with specific failures
4. DO NOT proceed with mission work until resolved
5. Halt all coordination until integrity restored
