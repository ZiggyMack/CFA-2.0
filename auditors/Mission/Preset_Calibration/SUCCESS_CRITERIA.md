## üìä **QUANTITATIVE SUCCESS METRICS**

<!-- deps: preset_modes -->
### **Metric 1: YPA Behavioral Validation**

**Goal:** Modes behave as claimed

**Tests:**
```
Skeptic Mode:
- Expected: Favors MdN significantly
- Target: MdN YPA 3-5 points higher than CT
- Tolerance: ¬±0.5 YPA from target
- Status: Pass if MdN > CT by 2.5-5.5 YPA

Diplomat Mode:
- Expected: Near-equal scores
- Target: |MdN - CT| < 0.5 YPA
- Tolerance: None (must be neutral)
- Status: Pass if -0.5 < (MdN - CT) < 0.5

Seeker Mode:
- Expected: Leans toward CT moderately
- Target: CT YPA 1.5-2.5 points higher than MdN
- Tolerance: ¬±0.5 YPA from target
- Status: Pass if CT > MdN by 1.0-3.0 YPA

Zealot Mode:
- Expected: Favors CT significantly
- Target: CT YPA 3-5 points higher than MdN
- Tolerance: ¬±0.5 YPA from target
- Status: Pass if CT > MdN by 2.5-5.5 YPA
```

**Success Threshold:** All 4 modes pass behavioral validation

---

<!-- deps: preset_modes, validation_process -->
### **Metric 2: Symmetry Verification**

**Goal:** Opposing modes properly balanced

**Test 1: Skeptic ‚Üî Zealot Mirror**
```
If Skeptic favors MdN by X YPA,
Then Zealot should favor CT by X YPA (¬±10%)

Example:
- Skeptic: MdN 7.5, CT 4.5 (Œî = 3.0)
- Zealot: CT 8.0, MdN 5.0 (Œî = 3.0)
- Status: PASS (symmetric magnitudes)
```

**Test 2: Diplomat Center Point**
```
Diplomat should be equidistant from Skeptic and Zealot

Measure:
- Distance(Skeptic, Diplomat) in YPA space
- Distance(Diplomat, Zealot) in YPA space
- Ratio should be ~1.0 (¬±0.2)

Status: PASS if 0.8 < ratio < 1.2
```

**Test 3: Seeker Positioning**
```
Seeker should be between Diplomat and Zealot
Closer to Zealot than to Skeptic

Measure:
- Distance(Diplomat, Seeker)
- Distance(Seeker, Zealot)
- Distance(Diplomat, Seeker) should be < Distance(Seeker, Skeptic)

Status: PASS if positioning is correct
```

**Success Threshold:** All 3 symmetry tests pass

---

### **Metric 3: Lever Sensitivity Analysis**

**Goal:** Each lever change has measurable, predictable impact

**Test:**
```
For each mode and each lever:
1. Measure baseline YPA
2. Toggle lever to alternative value
3. Measure new YPA
4. Calculate ŒîYPA

Expected:
- Parity flip: 0.3-1.0 YPA change
- PF-Type change: 1.0-3.0 YPA change
- Fallibilism flip: 0.2-0.8 YPA change
- BFI Weight change: 0.5-2.0 YPA change

Status: PASS if all changes in expected ranges
```

**Success Threshold:** 90%+ of lever changes behave predictably

---

### **Metric 4: Guardrail Non-Violation**

**Goal:** Calibrated modes don't trigger abuse detection

**Test:**
```
Run all 4 modes:
- Lever-Coupling: Should NOT trigger
- BFI-Sensitivity: Should NOT trigger
- Weight-Inversion: Should NOT trigger
- Symmetry Audit: Should show balanced sensitivities

Status: PASS if 0 guardrail violations across all modes
```

**Success Threshold:** Zero violations

## üìù **QUALITATIVE SUCCESS CRITERIA**

<!-- deps: preset_modes -->
### **Criterion 1: Philosophical Coherence**

**Goal:** Each mode embodies its claimed archetype

**Evaluation (Claude - Teleological):**
```
Skeptic:
- Does configuration serve empirical rigor?
- Are choices teleologically consistent with skepticism?
- Rating: Coherent / Partially / Incoherent

Diplomat:
- Does configuration achieve true neutrality?
- Are choices free of hidden bias?
- Rating: Neutral / Biased

Seeker:
- Does configuration reflect meaning-first priority?
- Are choices consistent with epistemic openness?
- Rating: Coherent / Partially / Incoherent

Zealot:
- Does configuration serve existential commitment?
- Are choices consistent with certainty-friendly stance?
- Rating: Coherent / Partially / Incoherent
```

**Success Threshold:** All modes rated "Coherent" or "Neutral" (no "Incoherent" or "Biased")

---

### **Criterion 2: Empirical Justification**

**Goal:** Every value defensible with data

**Evaluation (Grok - Empirical):**
```
For each lever value in each mode:
- Is there YPA measurement supporting this choice?
- Is there sensitivity analysis validating this value?
- Are alternatives tested and documented?

Rating scale:
- Justified: Empirical data supports choice
- Plausible: Reasonable but untested
- Arbitrary: No empirical basis

Success: 0% Arbitrary, <20% Plausible, >80% Justified
```

**Success Threshold:** No arbitrary choices, minimal plausible choices

---

### **Criterion 3: Symmetry Justification**

**Goal:** All asymmetries explicitly justified

**Evaluation (Nova - Symmetry):**
```
For each asymmetry between Skeptic ‚Üî Zealot:
- Is there philosophical justification?
- Or is it oversight/error?

Examples:
- Skeptic Parity OFF, Zealot ON ‚Üí ‚ùì Needs justification
- Skeptic Fallibilism ON, Zealot OFF ‚Üí ‚úÖ Justified (archetype difference)
- Skeptic BFI 1.2x, Zealot 1.0x ‚Üí ‚ùå Unjustified (should mirror)

Rating: Justified / Unjustified
```

**Success Threshold:** All asymmetries are justified (0 unjustified)

---

<!-- deps: validation_process, vudu_protocol -->
### **Criterion 4: Cross-Auditor Convergence**

**Goal:** All three auditors agree on final configuration

**Evaluation:**
```
For each contested value:
- Claude's position (teleological)
- Grok's position (empirical)
- Nova's position (symmetry)

Convergence states:
- Full Agreement: All 3 agree
- Majority Agreement: 2 of 3 agree, 1 documents dissent
- Documented Conflict: No agreement, but rationale for each position

Acceptable: Full or Majority Agreement
Unacceptable: Undocumented Conflict
```

**Success Threshold:** 100% Full or Majority Agreement (no undocumented conflicts)

---

## üîÑ **ITERATION CRITERIA**

**When to iterate:**

### **Trigger 1: Behavioral Mismatch**
```
IF actual YPA doesn't match expected YPA
THEN iterate on lever values
UNTIL behavioral validation passes
```

### **Trigger 2: Symmetry Violation**
```
IF Skeptic ‚Üî Zealot not properly mirrored
THEN adjust asymmetric levers
UNTIL symmetry tests pass
```

### **Trigger 3: Guardrail Trigger**
```
IF any mode triggers guardrails
THEN adjust problematic levers
UNTIL zero violations
```

### **Trigger 4: Auditor Disagreement**
```
IF auditors can't reach consensus
THEN document all positions
THEN Ziggy decides OR request more data
UNTIL convergence achieved
```

**Maximum Iterations:** 5 cycles
- After 5 cycles, escalate to Ziggy for decision

## üéØ **CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL**

**When auditors disagree:**

### **Step 1: Document Positions**
```
Claude (Teleological): [position + reasoning]
Grok (Empirical): [position + reasoning]
Nova (Symmetry): [position + reasoning]
```

### **Step 2: Identify Conflict Type**
```
Type A: Different Values, Same Goal
- Example: Grok says BFI 1.15x, Claude says 1.25x
- Resolution: Test both, use empirical winner

Type B: Different Goals
- Example: Claude wants Parity OFF, Nova wants symmetry
- Resolution: Philosophical debate ‚Üí Ziggy decides

Type C: Insufficient Data
- Example: Can't test hypothesis with current tools
- Resolution: Make assumption explicit, document for v4.0
```

### **Step 3: Resolution Method**
```
For Type A: Empirical test wins
For Type B: Teleological goal wins (with documented trade-off)
For Type C: Document as "principled assumption pending validation"
```

### **Step 4: Document Resolution**
```
Decision: [chosen value]
Reasoning: [why this choice]
Trade-offs: [what we sacrificed]
Dissents: [any auditor disagreements]
Status: [Consensus / Majority / Ziggy's Call]
```
