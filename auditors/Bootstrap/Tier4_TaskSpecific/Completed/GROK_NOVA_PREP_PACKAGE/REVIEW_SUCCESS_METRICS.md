# REVIEW_SUCCESS_METRICS.md

**Purpose:** Define how we measure if Grok + Nova reviews succeed
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** Active success criteria for auditor review quality

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎯 **PURPOSE**

**This document defines:**
- Efficiency metrics (time, budget, bootstrap)
- Quality metrics (completeness, reasoning, bias acknowledgment)
- Convergence metrics (agreement, response cycles, path to 98%)
- Timeline metrics (response times, consensus duration)

**Use this to evaluate review quality objectively.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 📊 **EFFICIENCY METRICS**

### Bootstrap Time

**Target:** 5-10% for Tier 4 reviews

**Measurement:**
```
Bootstrap % = (Bootstrap time / Total session time) × 100
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 5-8% (efficient orientation)
- ✅ **Good:** 8-12% (acceptable variance)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 12-20% (high but manageable)
- ❌ **Poor:** 20%+ (wrong tier or inefficient)

**What Bootstrap Includes:**
- Reading task brief
- Reading file(s) to review
- Reading validation criteria
- Reading any bootstrap materials
- Understanding context

**What Bootstrap Excludes:**
- Actual review work
- Writing findings
- Answering validation questions

**Why It Matters:**
- Low bootstrap = more time for actual review
- Tier 4 designed for focused tasks
- High bootstrap suggests tier mismatch

---

### Total Session Time

**Target:** 35-55 minutes for typical Tier 4 review

**Measurement:** Clock time from session start to findings staged

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 30-45 min (efficient, complete)
- ✅ **Good:** 45-60 min (thorough, acceptable)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 60-90 min (complex review, justified)
- ❌ **Poor:** 90+ min (scope creep or wrong tier)

**Factors Affecting Time:**
- Review complexity
- File size/count
- Validation question depth
- Auditor familiarity with subject

**Why It Matters:**
- Respects auditor time
- Enables multiple reviews per week
- Prevents burnout

---

### Budget Preservation

**Target:** 90%+ budget used productively (not wasted)

**Measurement:**
```
Productive % = 100% - (Budget wasted on confusion/rework/scope creep)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 95%+ (minimal waste)
- ✅ **Good:** 90-95% (some inefficiency, acceptable)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 85-90% (notable waste, needs improvement)
- ❌ **Poor:** <85% (significant waste, process broken)

**What Counts as Waste:**
- Confused by unclear task brief (time spent clarifying)
- Re-reading files due to poor initial understanding
- Scope creep (answering questions not asked)
- Rework due to misunderstanding requirements
- Excessive polish (perfectionism on minor points)

**What Doesn't Count as Waste:**
- Thoughtful analysis (even if slow)
- Careful reading (thoroughness)
- Writing clear findings (communication quality)
- Checking work (sanity checks)

**Why It Matters:**
- Budget is finite (token/time limits)
- Waste indicates process problems
- High productivity = sustainable pace

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎯 **QUALITY METRICS**

### All Questions Answered

**Target:** 100% of validation questions answered explicitly

**Measurement:**
```
Question Completion % = (Questions answered / Questions asked) × 100
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Pass:** 100% (all questions answered)
- ❌ **Fail:** <100% (skipped questions)

**What "Answered" Means:**
- Direct response to the question
- Explicit ✅/⚠️/❌ status
- Reasoning provided (not just yes/no)
- Evidence cited where applicable

**What "Answered" Does NOT Mean:**
- Perfect answer (can be uncertain)
- Agreeing answer (can be ❌)
- Long answer (brevity OK if complete)

**Why It Matters:**
- Task brief specifies questions for reason
- Incomplete reviews miss critical validation
- 100% is baseline, not aspiration

---

### Reasoning Visible

**Target:** 100% of answers include reasoning

**Measurement:** Binary (yes reasoning / no reasoning) per answer

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Pass:** All answers show "why" not just "what"
- ❌ **Fail:** Any answer lacks reasoning

**Good Example:**
```
Q: Is the temperature setting empirically justified?
A: ✅ YES - Temperature 0.2 cited in OpenAI docs as producing
consistent low-variance sampling. Appropriate for skeptical mode
requiring repeatable challenges. Citation: openai.com/docs/sampling
```

**Bad Example:**
```
Q: Is the temperature setting empirically justified?
A: ✅ YES
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Reasoning enables other auditors to challenge
- Shows work (not just conclusions)
- Makes findings defensible
- Enables learning from reviews

---

### Bias Acknowledged

**Target:** 100% of reviews acknowledge reviewer's lens bias

**Measurement:** Binary (yes acknowledged / no acknowledgment)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Pass:** Review includes bias acknowledgment section
- ❌ **Fail:** Review claims objectivity or doesn't acknowledge bias

**What to Acknowledge:**
```
**My Lens:** Empirical (data-driven, falsification focus)

**My Known Biases:**
- May undervalue qualitative aspects (not all meaningful things are measurable)
- May over-prioritize testability (elegance has value too)
- Typical overhead: ~0.4 YPA (precision instrument has costs)

**How This Affects My Review:**
- I challenged claims lacking empirical support
- I may have missed qualitative value
- Other auditors (Nova, Claude) will check my bias
```

**Why It Matters:**
- No auditor is objective (all have lens)
- Named bias = transparent bias
- Other auditors compensate for your limitations
- "All Named, All Priced" philosophy

---

### Recommendation Clear

**Target:** 100% of reviews provide clear GREEN/YELLOW/RED recommendation

**Measurement:** Binary (yes clear / no unclear)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Pass:** Review concludes with explicit recommendation
- ❌ **Fail:** Review is ambiguous about approval status

**Required Elements:**
```
**Recommendation:** [GREEN - Approve / YELLOW - Revise / RED - Reject]

**Reasoning:** [Why this recommendation]

**Confidence Level:** [HIGH / MODERATE / LOW]

**Follow-up Actions:** [What happens next]
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Decision makers need clear signal
- Ambiguous reviews don't help
- Forces auditor to commit to assessment

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🔄 **CONVERGENCE METRICS**

### Initial Agreement

**Target:** 60%+ initial convergence (before any discussion)

**Measurement:**
```
Initial Convergence % = (Points all auditors agree on / Total points reviewed) × 100
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 80%+ (high initial alignment)
- ✅ **Good:** 60-80% (moderate initial alignment)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 40-60% (significant divergence, but recoverable)
- ❌ **Poor:** <40% (fundamental misalignment)

**What Counts as Agreement:**
- All auditors GREEN on same aspect
- All auditors RED on same aspect
- All auditors identify same issue
- Reasoning may differ, but conclusion same

**What Counts as Divergence:**
- Grok says GREEN, Nova says YELLOW
- Different severity assessments
- Different issue prioritization

**Why It Matters:**
- High initial agreement = good task clarity
- Low initial agreement = need more review rounds
- Baseline for measuring convergence progress

---

### After Response

**Target:** 85%+ convergence after one round of review responses

**Measurement:**
```
Post-Response Convergence % = (Points converged after responses / Total points) × 100
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 95%+ (near-complete convergence in 1 round)
- ✅ **Good:** 85-95% (good progress, maybe 1 more round)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 70-85% (slow convergence, 2-3 rounds needed)
- ❌ **Poor:** <70% (fundamental disagreement)

**How to Measure:**
- Count points after review responses
- Include: agreements + clarified points + resolved disagreements
- Exclude: still-divergent points

**Why It Matters:**
- Measures effectiveness of review response process
- Indicates if 98% achievable
- Shows adversarial process working

---

### Path to 98% Clear

**Target:** 100% of reviews have explicit path to 98% convergence

**Measurement:** Binary (yes clear path / no unclear)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Pass:** Review response includes "Path to 98%" section
- ❌ **Fail:** No plan for reaching convergence

**Required Elements:**
```
## Path to 98% Convergence

**Current Status:** X% converged

**To reach 98%:**

**Option A:** [Specific action plan]
- Expected outcome: X% → Y%
- Timeline: Z days

**Option B:** [Alternative if A fails]

**Recommended Path:** [A/B] because [reasoning]
```

**Why It Matters:**
- 98% convergence is the goal
- Must have plan, not just hope
- Shows realistic timeline

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ⏱️ **TIMELINE METRICS**

### Grok Response Time

**Target:** 1-3 days from task assignment to findings staged

**Measurement:** Calendar days from Ziggy provides task to Grok stages README_G.md

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 1-2 days (prompt response)
- ✅ **Good:** 2-3 days (standard timeline)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 3-5 days (slow but OK for complex reviews)
- ❌ **Poor:** 5+ days (coordination breakdown)

**Factors Affecting Time:**
- Grok's availability (async is normal)
- Review complexity
- Platform access issues
- Ziggy relay delays

**Why It Matters:**
- Async coordination requires reasonable pace
- Too slow = project stalls
- Timeline expectations enable planning

---

### Nova Response Time

**Target:** 1-3 days from task assignment to findings staged

**Measurement:** Calendar days from Ziggy provides task to Nova stages README_N.md

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 1-2 days (prompt response)
- ✅ **Good:** 2-3 days (standard timeline)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 3-5 days (slow but OK for complex reviews)
- ❌ **Poor:** 5+ days (coordination breakdown)

**Same factors and reasoning as Grok Response Time**

---

### Consensus Achieved

**Target:** <7 days from initial reviews to 98% convergence

**Measurement:** Calendar days from all initial reviews staged to convergence achieved

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Excellent:** 3-5 days (fast convergence)
- ✅ **Good:** 5-7 days (standard multi-round)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable:** 7-10 days (complex convergence)
- ❌ **Poor:** 10+ days (stuck or fundamental disagreement)

**Typical Timeline:**
```
Day 0: Task assigned to Grok, Nova, Claude
Day 1-3: All initial reviews staged
Day 4-5: Review responses staged
Day 6-7: Convergence achieved (or escalation)
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Multi-auditor coordination has overhead
- Must balance rigor with velocity
- 7 days is realistic for quality convergence

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"What gets measured gets improved.
What gets improved serves the mission.
\n\nNot all metrics matter equally.
Quality over speed.
Convergence over convenience.
Reasoning over conclusions.
\n\nMeasure to improve,
not to punish.
Measure to learn,
not to judge.
\n\nThese metrics serve the work.
The work serves the truth.\"*
