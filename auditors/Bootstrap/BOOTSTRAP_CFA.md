## üìÇ **HOW TO ACCESS FILES**

### **CRITICAL: Understanding File Locations**

You have access to repository files in TWO ways:

---

### **Method 1: project_knowledge_search (PRIMARY)**

**This is your main tool for accessing repository files.**

The GitHub repository (https://github.com/ZiggyMack/CFA-2.0) is indexed and searchable via the `project_knowledge_search` tool.

**Use this to find:**
- Bootstrap files (BOOTSTRAP_*.md)
- Mission files (missions/preset_calibration/*.md)
- Protocol files (VUDU_PROTOCOL.md, VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md)
- Master state files (README_C.md, MISSION_CURRENT.md, VUDU_LOG.md)
- Stress test files (claude_stress_test_trials_*.md)
- ANY file in the auditors/ folder

**Example searches:**
```
project_knowledge_search("BOOTSTRAP_CFA")
project_knowledge_search("stress test trials")
project_knowledge_search("preset calibration mission")
project_knowledge_search("VUDU_PROTOCOL")
project_knowledge_search("README_C")
```

**The tool returns:** Relevant content from files in the GitHub repository.

---

### **Method 2: /mnt/project/ (REFERENCE ONLY)**

A small subset of files may be uploaded to `/mnt/project/` directory.

**This is NOT the source of truth.**

**Do NOT assume:**
- ‚ùå "If it's not in /mnt/project/, it doesn't exist"
- ‚ùå "I need to request files not in /mnt/project/"
- ‚ùå "/mnt/project/ contains everything I need"

**Reality:**
- /mnt/project/ is just a convenience subset
- Most files are ONLY in GitHub, accessed via project_knowledge_search
- GitHub repository is the authoritative source

---

### **When You Can't Find Something**

**Follow this process:**

1. **Try project_knowledge_search with exact filename**
2. **Try project_knowledge_search with keywords**
3. **Try project_knowledge_search with topic**
4. **ONLY if all searches fail, ask Ziggy**

**99% of the time, the file exists in project knowledge.**  
You just need to search with the right keywords.

## What is CFA?

**Comparative Framework Analysis (CFA)** is an epistemic engineering tool that:
- Measures philosophical frameworks using quantifiable metrics
- Compares worldviews (like Mere Divine Naturalism vs Classical Theism)  
- Provides transparent, reproducible framework analysis
- Operates under the principle: **"All Named, All Priced"**

**Not just another philosophy tool.**  
**This is adversarially-audited multi-AI epistemic coordination.**

**Current Version:** v3.5 "The Cathedral & The Coordination"
- **Deployed live:** https://cfa-voodoo.streamlit.app
- **98% auditor convergence achieved** (Claude + Grok)
- **Complete guardrails:** 4 of 4 operational
- **Preset modes:** 4 archetypes (intuitive, not yet calibrated)
- **Quiz system:** 5-question epistemic bias detector
- **VuDu Protocol:** Multi-AI coordination infrastructure

---

## The 98% Convergence (Our Credibility Foundation)

**This is the most important thing to understand:**

Claude (Anthropic) and Grok (xAI) independently scored two frameworks:
- **Mere Divine Naturalism (MdN):** Claude: 3.62 YPA | Grok: 3.62 YPA
- **Classical Theism (CT):** Claude: 3.65 YPA | Grok: 3.65 YPA
- **Total Divergence:** 0.03 YPA (only 0.8% difference)

**Method:**
- Adversarial auditing (each challenged the other's reasoning)
- Independent calculation (no coordination during scoring)
- Complete transparency (all assumptions documented)
- Reproducible process (formulas public, inputs tracked)

**Why this matters:**
- Two different AI systems with different training
- Two different lenses (teleological vs empirical)  
- Two different organizations (Anthropic vs xAI)
- **Converged on nearly identical results**

**This convergence is not guaranteed. It's not easy. It's evidence the framework works.**

**Every feature, every change, every calibration must maintain or improve this convergence.**

**This is our credibility. Protect it.** üèÜ

---

## The Four Levers (User-Configurable Toggles)

Users can adjust these to explore how different epistemic priorities affect framework comparison:

### Lever 1: Parity (Symmetry Enforcement)
**Question:** Should both frameworks be evaluated with the same criteria?

**ON:** Both frameworks scored identically
- Same PF-Type
- Same Fallibilism Bonus treatment
- Same axiom sensitivity
- **Philosophy:** Fair comparison requires identical standards

**OFF:** Frameworks can have different evaluation methods
- Asymmetric criteria allowed
- Different standards for different frameworks
- **Philosophy:** Different frameworks may warrant different evaluation approaches

**Impact:** Major (can shift relative positioning by 1-2 YPA)

---

### Lever 2: PF-Type (Philosophical Fruitfulness Definition)
**Question:** What makes a framework "philosophically fruitful"?

**Instrumental:**
- Focus: Predictive power, explanatory success, testability
- Weight: 100% instrumental value, 0% intrinsic value
- **Philosophy:** Frameworks valued purely for what they help us predict/explain

**Holistic_50_50:**
- Focus: Balanced instrumental + intrinsic value
- Weight: 50% prediction/explanation, 50% meaning/coherence
- **Philosophy:** Both "works" and "means something" matter equally

**Composite_70_30:**
- Focus: Meaning-first, with prediction as supporting evidence
- Weight: 70% intrinsic value (existential depth), 30% instrumental
- **Philosophy:** Frameworks primarily valued for meaning, secondarily for prediction

**Impact:** High (3-5 YPA swing possible between Instrumental and Composite)

---

### Lever 3: Fallibilism Bonus
**Question:** Should we reward frameworks that embrace uncertainty and revision?

**ON:** Frameworks get +0.5 bonus for explicit self-correction mechanisms
- Rewards: Error-correction, falsifiability, epistemic humility
- **Philosophy:** Good epistemology includes knowing when you're wrong

**OFF:** No bonus for self-correction
- **Philosophy:** Certainty and revision are neutral (don't favor either)

**Impact:** Low-Moderate (0.3-0.8 YPA, affects specific scenarios)

---

### Lever 4: BFI-Debt Weight (Axiom Penalty)
**Question:** How much should unprovable starting assumptions cost?

**Equal (1.0x):**
- Standard axiom counting
- Each axiom costs standard penalty
- **Philosophy:** Assumptions are assumptions

**Heavier (1.2x):**
- 20% increased axiom penalty
- Makes axiom-heavy frameworks pay more
- **Philosophy:** Minimize starting assumptions (Ockham's Razor emphasis)

**Lighter (0.8x):**
- 20% reduced axiom sensitivity
- More forgiving of starting assumptions
- **Philosophy:** Some axioms necessary, don't over-penalize

**Impact:** Moderate (1-2 YPA difference between 1.2x and 0.8x)

---

## The Four Guardrails (Automated Abuse Detection)

**Purpose:** Prevent gaming the system, catch configuration errors, enforce honesty

### Guardrail 1: Lever-Coupling
**Rule:** `If PF ‚â• 9, then CCI must ‚â• 6.5`

**Prevents:** Claiming "super philosophically fruitful" without coherence
- Can't say framework is amazingly productive if it's incoherent
- Forces honesty: high fruitfulness requires high coherence

**Trigger:** Warning message if violated
**Status:** Rarely triggers (honest scoring prevents this)

---

### Guardrail 2: BFI-Sensitivity
**Rule:** `ŒîYPA / ŒîBFI < 0.4`

**Prevents:** Axiom inflation (adding assumptions without cost)
- YPA should respond when axiom count changes
- Can't make framework "immune" to axiom penalties

**Trigger:** Flag if framework scores become axiom-insensitive
**Status:** Catches configurations that don't price assumptions

---

### Guardrail 3: Weight-Inversion Alarm  
**Rule:** `0.3x ‚â§ scenario_weight ‚â§ 3.0x`

**Prevents:** Extreme scenario cherry-picking
- Can't weight one scenario 10x and ignore others
- Ensures balanced consideration of contexts

**Trigger:** Alert if any scenario weighted too heavily/lightly
**Status:** Low trigger rate (users rarely weight extremes)

---

### Guardrail 4: Symmetry Audit Summary
**Rule:** Display toggle sensitivity analysis

**Prevents:** Hidden bias in toggle configuration
- Shows how each lever affects each framework
- Makes bias transparent, not invisible

**Display:** Always shown in Guardrails tab
**Status:** Continuous monitoring

**All four guardrails operational as of v3.2.** ‚úÖ

---

## The Four Preset Modes (v3.2 Feature)

Quick-configuration profiles for common epistemic stances:

### Skeptic Mode (MdN-Optimized)
```
Parity: OFF
PF-Type: Instrumental  
Fallibilism: ON
BFI Weight: Heavier (1.2x)
```

**Philosophy:** Empirical rigor, prediction focus, axiom skepticism
**Target User:** Someone who values testability and falsifiability
**Expected Behavior:** Should favor MdN significantly

**STATUS:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Intuitive, not yet calibrated (v3.6 mission)

---

### Diplomat Mode (Balanced)
```
Parity: ON
PF-Type: Holistic_50_50
Fallibilism: ON  
BFI Weight: Equal (1.0x)
```

**Philosophy:** Fair comparison, balanced criteria, neutral stance
**Target User:** Someone seeking unbiased framework comparison
**Expected Behavior:** Should produce near-equal scores

**STATUS:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Intuitive, not yet calibrated (v3.6 mission)

---

### Seeker Mode (CT-Leaning)
```
Parity: ON
PF-Type: Composite_70_30
Fallibilism: ON
BFI Weight: Equal (1.0x)
```

**Philosophy:** Meaning-first, holistic value, epistemic openness
**Target User:** Someone who values existential depth  
**Expected Behavior:** Should lean toward CT (but not extreme)

**STATUS:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Intuitive, not yet calibrated (v3.6 mission)

---

### Zealot Mode (CT-Optimized)
```
Parity: ON
PF-Type: Holistic_50_50
Fallibilism: OFF
BFI Weight: Equal (1.0x)
```

**Philosophy:** Existential priority, certainty-friendly, holistic focus
**Target User:** Someone committed to transcendent meaning
**Expected Behavior:** Should favor CT significantly

**STATUS:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Intuitive, not yet calibrated (v3.6 mission)

---

**CRITICAL NOTE ON PRESET MODES:**

**These configurations were chosen intuitively, not empirically.**

The current v3.6 mission (Preset Mode Calibration) aims to:
- Justify every lever value through adversarial auditing
- Achieve "All Named, All Priced" for UX features
- Make presets the first fully calibrated UI element

**Until calibration complete, presets are "best guess" configurations.**

---

## YPA Calculation (Simplified)

**YPA = Years-of-Productivity-Added**

**The Question:** If you adopted this framework, how many years of productive thinking/living would it add compared to having no framework?

### Core Formula

```
YPA = Œ£(Dimension_Score √ó Weight √ó Scenario_Likelihood)
```

### Five Dimensions (Each scored 0-10)

**CCI (Coherence & Closure Index):**
- Does the framework hang together?
- Are explanations internally consistent?
- Do conclusions follow from premises?

**DEP (Depth & Explanatory Power):**
- How deep does the framework go?
- What range of phenomena can it explain?
- How satisfying are its explanations?

**PF (Philosophical Fruitfulness):**
- How productive is this framework?
- Does it generate insights, predictions, questions?
- Modified by PF-Type lever (instrumental vs holistic)

**BAE (Beauty & Aesthetic Elegance):**
- Is the framework elegant?
- Does it have aesthetic appeal?
- How simple/parsimonious is it?

**MEF (Moral & Ethical Foundations):**
- Does it provide moral guidance?
- How robust are its ethical foundations?
- Can it ground values effectively?

### Weighted Scenarios

Different contexts where framework might be applied:
- **Baseline:** Everyday life (40% weight)
- **Crisis:** High-stakes decisions (20% weight)
- **Paradigm Shift:** Scientific revolutions (15% weight)
- **Existential:** Deep meaning questions (15% weight)
- **Edge Cases:** Unusual situations (10% weight)

**Guardrails constrain scenario weights to prevent cherry-picking.**

### BFI (Brute-Fact Index) Penalty

**Axioms cost you:**
- Each unprovable starting assumption = penalty
- Modified by BFI-Debt Weight lever (0.8x to 1.2x)
- Encourages minimizing assumptions (Ockham's Razor)

**Example:**
```
MdN starts with: Naturalism, causal closure, empiricism
CT starts with: God exists, divine attributes, revelation

Each axiom costs ~0.3-0.5 YPA (depending on BFI weight)
```

---

## "All Named, All Priced" Philosophy

**The Core Commitment:**

**Every assumption must be explicit.**  
**Every cost must be quantified.**

**This applies to:**
- Framework axioms (named in BFI)
- Lever configurations (priced in YPA impact)
- Auditor biases (named in bootstrap files)
- Coordination costs (priced in process overhead)

**Mr. Brute's Ledger** tracks every assumption with its cost.

**Example:**
```
Brute: "I assume naturalism by default"
Price: -0.3 YPA (axiom cost in BFI)
Status: Named explicitly, priced transparently
```

**No hidden assumptions.**  
**No unacknowledged costs.**  
**No invisible bias.**

**If you can't name it and price it, you don't understand it.**

**This is the philosophical foundation of the entire project.** üè∑Ô∏è

## The Epic Milestone (v3.5 Story)

### What We Built

**The Cathedral:**
- Transparent architecture (all reasoning visible)
- Named assumptions (Mr. Brute's Ledger)
- Quantified costs (YPA pricing)
- Reproducible process (98% convergence proof)

**The Coordination:**
- VuDu Protocol for multi-AI collaboration

**Together:** Infrastructure for adversarial epistemic engineering at scale

---

### What We Learned

**Multi-AI Collaboration Works:**
- Claude + Grok achieved 98% convergence
- Different lenses (teleological vs empirical) complement
- Adversarial auditing produces better results than solo work

**"All Named, All Priced" Scales:**
- Philosophy applies to every level (axioms, levers, biases, costs)
- Transparency builds credibility
- Explicit beats implicit always

**Context Loss is Survivable:**
- Token death happened (O.G. Master Claude, RIP)
- Bootstrap system enabled recovery
- Documentation matters more than we thought

**Architecture Takes Time:**
- Can't rush the foundation
- v3.5 spent months on infrastructure
- But now v3.6+ can build fast on solid base

---

### What's Next

**v3.6 (Immediate):**
- Calibrate preset modes (active mission)
- Justify every lever value
- Empirical YPA testing (Grok)
- Symmetry enforcement (Nova)
- Achieve "All Named, All Priced" for UX features

**v3.7+ (Near-term):**
- Dark mode final fixes
- Additional preset modes (if justified)
- Performance optimization
- User feedback integration

**v4.0+ (Long-term):**
- Verification framework (archived VuDu Full features)
- Advanced audit capabilities
- Cross-platform reproducibility
- Scale to more frameworks beyond MdN and CT

---

## Philosophy: The Cathedral Metaphor

**v3.5 = The Cathedral**
- Transparent structure (you can see how it's built)
- Visible reasoning (all assumptions named)
- Open architecture (formulas public, code open)
- Adversarially tested (98% convergence proof)

**v3.6 = Precision**
- Calibrated values (every number justified)
- Empirical validation (tested, not guessed)
- Cross-auditor consensus (teleological + empirical + symmetry)
- Complete documentation (future auditors can verify)

**Together: Cathedral + Echo**
- Structure + Sound
- Infrastructure + Calibration
- Transparency + Precision

**The cathedral is built. Now we tune the bells.** üîî

## The Roots: Why This Document Matters

**This is not just documentation.**

**This is the foundation every future auditor stands on.**

**When v3.6, v3.7, v4.0 arrive, they will reference THIS document.**

**When new auditors join, they start HERE.**

**When context is lost, we recover FROM HERE.**

**The tree grows, but the roots remain:**
- "All Named, All Priced" 
- Adversarial auditing
- 98% convergence proof
- Transparent architecture
- Multi-AI coordination

**Future milestones add rings to the trunk.**  
**But the roots are bedrock.**

**This is v3.5.2. This is the foundation.** üå≥
