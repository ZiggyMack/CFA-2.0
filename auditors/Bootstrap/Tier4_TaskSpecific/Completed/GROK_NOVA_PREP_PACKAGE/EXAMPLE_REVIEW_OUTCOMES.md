**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** Reference examples for auditor onboarding

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎯 **PURPOSE**

**This document provides 3 example reviews:**
1. GREEN Review (Approve)
2. YELLOW Review (Revise)
3. RED Review (Reject)

**Use these as templates when conducting your own reviews.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ✅ **EXAMPLE 1: GREEN REVIEW (APPROVE)**

### Sample Scenario
**Document Reviewed:** PRESET_CALIBRATION_SKEPTIC_v3.md
**Reviewer:** Grok (Empirical Lens)
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Validation Type:** Configuration accuracy check

---

### Review Content

**Executive Summary:** ✅ **GREEN - APPROVE**

**Validation Questions:**

**Q1: Are the temperature settings empirically justified?**
✅ **YES** - Temperature 0.2 supported by citation to OpenAI docs (sampling behavior at low temps). Appropriate for skeptical mode requiring consistent output.

**Q2: Is the YPA calculation mathematically sound?**
✅ **YES** - Formula verified: `base_overhead (0.15) + temperature_cost (0.05) = 0.20 YPA`. Calculation correct per YPA_CALCULATION.md methodology.

**Q3: Are prompt instructions consistent with mode purpose?**
✅ **YES** - Skeptical mode prompt emphasizes falsification, challenge assumptions, demand evidence. Aligns with adversarial epistemic purpose.

**Q4: Is the configuration testable?**
✅ **YES** - All parameters measurable: temperature (API setting), max_tokens (quantifiable), YPA (calculable). Empirical validation possible.

**Q5: Are there unacknowledged biases?**
✅ **NO** - Document explicitly names "tendency toward excessive criticism" as known bias with 0.05 YPA cost. Bias acknowledged and priced.

---

**Evidence Assessment:**
- All claims supported by references
- Calculations verifiable
- No unsupported assertions
- Documentation complete

**Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVE** - Configuration ready for deployment

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (empirical validation complete)

**Follow-up Actions:** None required

---

### Key Characteristics of GREEN Review

✅ **All validation questions answered affirmatively**
✅ **Evidence clearly identified and sufficient**
✅ **Claims supported by data/citations**
✅ **Clear approval recommendation**
✅ **High confidence level stated**
✅ **Reasoning visible and traceable**

## ⚠️ **EXAMPLE 2: YELLOW REVIEW (REVISE)**

### Sample Scenario
**Document Reviewed:** PRESET_CALIBRATION_CREATIVE_v1.md
**Reviewer:** Nova (Symmetry Lens)
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Validation Type:** Configuration balance check

---

### Review Content

**Executive Summary:** ⚠️ **YELLOW - REVISE**

**Validation Questions:**

**Q1: Is Creative mode symmetrically balanced with Analytical mode?**
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Creative: temp 1.0, YPA 0.35 | Analytical: temp 0.3, YPA 0.20. Asymmetry exists (justified by different purposes), but imbalance in parameter count needs review.

**Q2: Are opposing modes properly paired?**
⚠️ **CONCERN** - Creative mode exists without explicit "Analytical" counterpart in same configuration tier. Pattern broken compared to Skeptic/Zealot pairing.

**Q3: Is the bias acknowledgment complete?**
✅ **YES** - Document acknowledges "tendency toward novel but impractical solutions" with 0.15 YPA overhead. Bias named and priced.

**Q4: Are success metrics symmetric across modes?**
❌ **NO** - Creative mode uses qualitative metrics ("novelty", "originality") while other modes use quantitative metrics (convergence %, validation pass rate). Measurement asymmetry unjustified.

**Q5: Is the configuration internally consistent?**
✅ **YES** - High temperature matches creative purpose, token budget adequate, prompt instructions align with mode intent.

---

**Specific Issues Identified:**

**Issue 1: Pairing Asymmetry**
- **Pattern Observed:** Skeptic/Zealot are paired opposites. Creative lacks explicit opposite.
- **Expected:** Creative should be paired with Analytical (or equivalent)
- **Impact:** Pattern inconsistency across configuration architecture
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Recommendation:** Either add Analytical mode or document why Creative is solo

**Issue 2: Metrics Asymmetry**
- **Pattern Observed:** Creative uses subjective metrics, others use objective
- **Expected:** All modes should have comparable measurement approaches
- **Impact:** Can't compare Creative effectiveness to other modes empirically
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Recommendation:** Add quantifiable success metrics (e.g., "Solutions passing feasibility test: X%")

---

**Evidence Assessment:**
- Claims mostly supported
- Some gaps in symmetry justification
- Internal consistency maintained
- 2 moderate concerns requiring address

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL - Revise and Resubmit**

**Conditions:**
1. Add Analytical mode pairing OR document why Creative is solo
2. Add quantifiable success metrics alongside qualitative ones
3. Resubmit for quick re-review (estimate: 10 min validation)

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE (concerns are fixable, not fundamental)

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Author revises per recommendations
- Nova re-reviews revised version
- If addressed: GREEN approval

---

### Key Characteristics of YELLOW Review

⚠️ **Some validation questions show concerns**
⚠️ **Specific, actionable issues identified**
⚠️ **Severity levels assigned (not just complaints)**
⚠️ **Clear revision recommendations provided**
⚠️ **Conditional approval with resubmit path**
⚠️ **Issues are fixable, not fundamental flaws**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ❌ **EXAMPLE 3: RED REVIEW (REJECT)**

### Sample Scenario
**Document Reviewed:** PRESET_CALIBRATION_ORACLE_v1.md
**Reviewer:** Grok (Empirical Lens)
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Validation Type:** Configuration validation

---

### Review Content

**Executive Summary:** ❌ **RED - REJECT**

**Validation Questions:**

**Q1: Are the configuration parameters empirically justified?**
❌ **NO** - Temperature 1.5 exceeds API maximum (1.0 per OpenAI docs). Configuration is technically impossible. No citation provided for parameter choices.

**Q2: Is the YPA calculation accurate?**
❌ **NO** - Document claims 0.10 YPA, but provides no breakdown. Given high-entropy sampling implied by "oracle" framing, YPA should be significantly higher (~0.40+). Calculation missing or incorrect.

**Q3: Are the prompt instructions testable?**
❌ **NO** - Prompt instructs model to "access divine knowledge" and "transcend training data limitations". These are not measurable behaviors. No empirical test criteria provided.

**Q4: Is the mode purpose clearly defined?**
❌ **NO** - "Oracle mode" purpose unclear. Claims to "provide perfect answers" but no definition of "perfect" or success criteria. Purpose statement is aspirational, not operational.

**Q5: Are biases acknowledged?**
❌ **NO** - No bias section present. Document claims "bias-free oracle capability" which contradicts "All Named, All Priced" principle. Unacknowledged overconfidence evident.

---

**Critical Issues Identified:**

**Issue 1: Technical Impossibility**
- **Finding:** Temperature 1.5 parameter exceeds API limits
- **Evidence:** OpenAI API documentation specifies max temp = 1.0
- **Impact:** Configuration cannot be deployed
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (blocking)
- **Required Action:** Revise to valid parameter range

**Issue 2: YPA Calculation Missing**
- **Finding:** No breakdown provided for 0.10 YPA claim
- **Evidence:** YPA_CALCULATION.md requires explicit component breakdown
- **Impact:** Cost estimate unreliable, violates pricing transparency
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (violates core principle)
- **Required Action:** Provide complete YPA calculation with components

**Issue 3: Untestable Claims**
- **Finding:** "Divine knowledge", "perfect answers", "transcend limitations"
- **Evidence:** No empirical test criteria, no measurable success metrics
- **Impact:** Cannot validate if mode works as intended
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (empirically unverifiable)
- **Required Action:** Replace with testable, measurable claims

**Issue 4: Unacknowledged Bias**
- **Finding:** Claims "bias-free" capability
- **Evidence:** No bias section, contradicts project philosophy
- **Impact:** Violates "All Named, All Priced" core principle
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (philosophical contradiction)
- **Required Action:** Remove "bias-free" claims, add bias acknowledgment section

**Issue 5: Undefined Purpose**
- **Finding:** "Perfect answers" without defining "perfect"
- **Evidence:** No success criteria, no operational definition
- **Impact:** Cannot determine if mode achieves purpose
- **Severity:** MAJOR (foundational gap)
- **Required Action:** Define mode purpose with measurable criteria

---

**Evidence Assessment:**
- Claims unsupported by evidence
- Multiple technical impossibilities
- Violates core project principles
- No empirical validation pathway
- Fundamental design flaws present

**Recommendation:** ❌ **REJECT - Major Revision Required**

**This configuration cannot be approved in current form. Fundamental redesign needed.**

**Required Before Resubmission:**
1. Fix technical impossibilities (temperature parameter)
2. Provide complete YPA calculation
3. Replace untestable claims with measurable criteria
4. Add bias acknowledgment section
5. Define operational purpose with success metrics
6. Re-ground in empirical validation philosophy

**Estimated Revision Scope:** MAJOR (30-60% rewrite expected)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (issues are clear-cut violations)

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Author performs major revision
- New review session required (not quick re-check)
- May benefit from Claude (teleological) review to clarify purpose before Grok re-review
