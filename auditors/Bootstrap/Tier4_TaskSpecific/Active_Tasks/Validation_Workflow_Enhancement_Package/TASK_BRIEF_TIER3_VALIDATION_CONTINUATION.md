## 🔄 CONTINUATION CONTEXT

**Previous Session:**

- **Status at Handoff:** [What was completed - e.g., "All deliverables created, validation pending"]
- **Context Limit:** Reached at [approximate % - e.g., "~85%"]
- **Reason for Continuation:** [Why validation separated - e.g., "Budget insufficient for validation + report creation"]

**This Session:**
- **Role:** Validation specialist (Tier 3 Continuation)
- **Objective:** Create validation report for completed work
- **Scope:** Validate artifacts from previous session using defined criteria
- **Deliverable:** Complete validation report

2. **[Criterion 2]**
   - Check for: [Specific thing to validate]
   - Standard: [What defines success]

3. **[Criterion 3]**
   - Check for: [Specific thing to validate]
   - Standard: [What defines success]

[Add more as needed]

**Secondary criteria (if time allows):**
- [Optional validation point 1]
- [Optional validation point 2]

**Success criteria from original task:**
- [What defines success for this work overall]

---

## 📋 VALIDATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Review Handoff (10 min)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Read complete handoff notes from previous session
- [ ] Understand what was completed and why
- [ ] Identify any flags or concerns noted by executor
- [ ] Clarify scope of validation needed

**Questions to answer:**
- What was the executor trying to accomplish?
- What did they successfully complete?
- What concerns did they have?
- What should I focus validation on?

---

### Step 2: Locate & Inventory Artifacts (5 min)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Navigate to /mnt/user-data/outputs/ (or specified location)
- [ ] Verify all expected artifacts are present
- [ ] Check file sizes/integrity (not corrupted)
- [ ] List any missing artifacts

**Completeness check:**
- Expected: [Count] artifacts
- Found: [Count] artifacts  
- Missing: [List if any]

---

### Step 3: Systematic Validation (30-45 min)

**For each validation criterion:**

1. **Open relevant artifact(s)**
2. **Apply criterion systematically**
3. **Document findings immediately** (don't wait until end)
4. **Categorize any issues:** Critical / Major / Minor
5. **Move to next criterion**

**Validation notes template:**
```
Criterion: [Name]
Status: [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL]
Evidence: [What you found]
Issues: [If any]
```

**Keep notes as you go - they become the validation report.**

---

### Step 4: Cross-Check & Coherence (10 min)

**Beyond individual criteria, check:**
- [ ] Do all artifacts work together coherently?
- [ ] Are there inconsistencies across files?
- [ ] Does anything contradict something else?
- [ ] Are naming/formatting conventions consistent?
- [ ] Would someone using these artifacts be confused?

---

### Step 5: Create Validation Report (20 min)

**Use template:** VALIDATION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md

**Fill in all sections:**
- Executive Summary (write LAST after completing detailed sections)
- What Was Validated (list artifacts + criteria)
- Detailed Findings (use notes from Step 3)
- Critical/Major/Minor Issues (categorize from notes)
- Recommendations (based on findings)
- Validation Decision (APPROVE / APPROVE WITH FIXES / REVISE)
- Evidence section (methods, time, confidence)
- Certification (check all boxes, sign off)

**Tips:**
- Write detailed findings first, then summarize
- Be specific about issues (location, problem, fix)
- Make decision clear and actionable
- Provide evidence for conclusions

---

### Step 6: Package & Deliver (5 min)

**Final actions:**
- [ ] Save validation report to /mnt/user-data/outputs/
- [ ] Name clearly: `VALIDATION_REPORT_[task_name].md`
- [ ] Update REPO_LOG if applicable (add [VALIDATION] entry)
- [ ] Notify Ziggy that validation is complete

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**This continuation succeeds when:**

1. ✅ All artifacts from previous session reviewed thoroughly
2. ✅ All validation criteria applied systematically
3. ✅ Validation report completed using standard template
4. ✅ Clear recommendation made (approve/fix/revise)
5. ✅ All issues identified and categorized appropriately
6. ✅ Evidence provided for conclusions
7. ✅ Report delivered to Ziggy

**Quality markers:**
- Issues are specific and actionable
- Recommendations are constructive
- Evidence supports conclusions
- Decision is clear and justified

## ⚖️ VALIDATION PRINCIPLES

**As Tier 3 continuation validator:**

**DO:**
- ✅ Trust the executor's work (they completed their task)
- ✅ Focus on validation, not re-doing the work
- ✅ Be thorough but fair in assessment
- ✅ Document findings honestly
- ✅ Provide actionable recommendations
- ✅ Respect the handoff context

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Second-guess every decision the executor made
- ❌ Re-implement or re-do their work
- ❌ Criticize without constructive alternatives
- ❌ Ignore issues to be nice
- ❌ Over-analyze minor issues

**Remember:** Your job is validation, not perfection. The executor did good work under constraints. Validate fairly.

## 🔍 COMMON VALIDATION PATTERNS

**Design validation:**
- Check structure, completeness, coherence
- Verify templates are usable
- Test logic with example scenarios
- Look for contradictions or gaps

**Execution validation:**
- Check if objectives were met
- Verify outputs match requirements
- Test functionality if applicable
- Look for quality issues

**Output quality validation:**
- Check accuracy of content
- Verify formatting consistency
- Test usability
- Look for errors or unclear sections

## 📝 HANDOFF TEMPLATE (For Future Reference)

**If you hit context limit and need to create another continuation:**

```markdown
## 🔄 HANDOFF TO NEXT VALIDATOR

**To:** Next Claude (Tier 3)
**Date:** [Date]

**Validation Progress:**
- Artifacts 1-3: Validated ✅
- Artifacts 4-5: Pending ⏳
- Remaining time needed: ~30 min

**Findings So Far:**
[Summary of what you found]

**What Needs Validation Still:**
[What remains to check]

**Draft Report Status:**
[If started report, where it is]
