# Relay Folder - Staging Area

**Purpose:** Temporary staging for auditor findings before integration

**Folders:**
- Claude_Incoming/ - Master Branch Claude stages findings here
- Grok_Incoming/ - Grok stages empirical test results here
- Nova_Incoming/ - Nova stages symmetry audits here

**Process:**
1. Auditor creates finding document
2. Stages in their incoming/ folder
3. Ziggy or Master Branch reviews
4. Approved findings integrated into main docs
5. Staging file archived or deleted

**This folder should be mostly empty except during active coordination.**
