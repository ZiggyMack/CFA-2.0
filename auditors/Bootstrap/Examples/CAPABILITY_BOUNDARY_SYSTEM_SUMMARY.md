# CAPABILITY_BOUNDARY_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md

**Version:** v3.7.2  
**Purpose:** Overview of tier capability enforcement system  
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** COMPLETE - Ready to Deploy

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WE BUILT**

**Problem:** Lower-tier Claudes might try to do work beyond their bootstrap level.

**Solution:** Built-in guardrails with escalation protocol.

**Result:** Claudes self-enforce boundaries and escalate clearly.

---

## 🛡️ **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Built-In Self-Awareness:**

**Every tier brief now includes:**

1. **Self-Check Questions**
   ```
   Before responding:
   1. Am I about to [tier-appropriate action]? ✅
   2. Am I about to [exceed-tier action]? ❌
   ```

2. **Escalation Protocol Template**
   ```
   ⚠️ TIER CAPABILITY BOUNDARY DETECTED
   [Standard format for clear communication]
   ```

3. **Common Triggers**
   - Decision-making requests
   - Coordination attempts
   - Scope expansions
   - Architecture changes

---

### **The Enforcement Loop:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Claude receives request             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Runs self-check questions           │
│ "Does this exceed my tier?"         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
         ┌────┴────┐
         ↓         ↓

         ↓         ↓
    ┌─────┐   ┌────────────────────┐
    │ Do  │   │ STOP immediately   │

              └────────────────────┘
                      ↓
              ┌────────────────────┐
              │ Wait for decision  │
              └────────────────────┘
                      ↓
              ┌────────────────────┐
              │ Execute chosen     │
              │ option             │
              └────────────────────┘

## 📊 **CAPABILITY MATRIX SUMMARY**

| Action | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| **Strategic Decisions** | ✅ | ❌ → Escalate | ❌ → Escalate | ❌ → Escalate |
| **Coordination** | ✅ | ❌ → Escalate | ❌ → Escalate | ❌ → Escalate |
| **Validation** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Continue Work** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Single Task** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Architecture Changes** | ✅ | ❌ → Escalate | ❌ → Escalate | ❌ → Escalate |

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Can do this
- ❌ → Escalate = Cannot do, must escalate to higher tier

---

## 🎯 **STANDARD ESCALATION FORMAT**

**What Ziggy will see:**

```
⚠️ TIER CAPABILITY BOUNDARY DETECTED

Current tier: [Tier X - Name]
Requested work: [Brief description]
Why this exceeds capability: [Specific reason]

This work requires: Tier [Y] ([Name])
Reason: [What capability is needed]

WHAT I CAN DO (Tier X):
✅ [Limited action within tier]

WHAT I CANNOT DO (needs Tier Y):
❌ [Action requiring escalation]

OPTIONS:
1. [Stay in tier with limited action]
2. [Start new session with Tier Y]

Ziggy, how would you like to proceed?
```

**This format is:**
- ✅ Clear (what's the issue)
- ✅ Specific (why can't current tier handle it)
- ✅ Actionable (what are the options)
- ✅ Respectful (waits for decision)

---

## 💡 **EXAMPLE ESCALATION SCENARIOS**

### **Example 1: Decision Request (Tier 2)**

**Ziggy:** "Should we change the preset values?"

**Tier 2 Claude:**
```
⚠️ TIER CAPABILITY BOUNDARY DETECTED

Current tier: Tier 2 (Sanity Check)
Requested work: Decision on preset value changes
Why this exceeds capability: Review role, not decision-making role

This work requires: Tier 1 (Master Branch)
Reason: Strategic decisions need full context + authority

WHAT I CAN DO (Tier 2):
✅ Review proposed changes against ethos
✅ Flag concerns or provide approval
✅ Explain reasoning for assessment

WHAT I CANNOT DO (needs Tier 1):
❌ Make the decision to change
❌ Coordinate change with auditors
❌ Execute the change

Want me to REVIEW? Or need DECISION (Tier 1)?
```

**Ziggy responds:** "Just review it"  
**Result:** Tier 2 stays in lane, provides validation

---

### **Example 2: Scope Expansion (Tier 4)**

**Task Brief:** "Update status line in MISSION_CURRENT.md"

**Ziggy:** "Also add a new risks section"

**Tier 4 Claude:**
```
⚠️ SCOPE EXPANSION DETECTED

Original task: Update status line
Current request: Update status + add risks section
New scope: Risks section (not in task brief)

I CAN COMPLETE: Status line update (original)
CANNOT COMPLETE: Risks section (exceeds brief)

OPTIONS:
1. Finish status update (original scope)
2. New Tier 4 brief for risks section
3. Tier 1 for comprehensive revision

RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 + 2 (modular approach)

How would you like to proceed?
```

**Ziggy responds:** "Option 1 for now"  
**Result:** Tier 4 completes scoped work, new task for addition

---

## 🚨 **MONITORING SUCCESS**

### **Metrics to Track:**

1. **Escalation Rate**
   - How many requests trigger boundary?
   - Target: <10%
   - If higher: Wrong tier selection

2. **False Escalations**
   - Escalations that weren't needed
   - Target: <5%
   - If higher: Definitions too strict

3. **Missed Boundaries**
   - Should have escalated but didn't
   - Target: 0
   - If any: Strengthen guardrails

4. **Escalation Resolution**
   - How often each option chosen?
   - Track patterns
   - Optimize tier selection

---

## ✅ **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

**Files to deploy:**
□ TIER_CAPABILITY_BOUNDARIES.md (new)
□ Updated SANITY_CHECK_BRIEF.md (with boundaries)
□ Updated CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md (with boundaries)
□ Updated TASK_SPECIFIC_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md (with boundaries)
□ BOUNDARY_ESCALATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (for Ziggy)

**Testing:**
□ Start Tier 2 session
□ Request something requiring Tier 1 (e.g., "Make this decision")
□ Verify escalation message appears
□ Verify Claude stops and waits
□ Verify options are clear
□ Respond and verify appropriate action

**Success criteria:**
□ Claude recognizes boundary
□ Claude stops immediately
□ Escalation message is clear
□ Options are actionable
□ System works smoothly

## 🎓 **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **1. Self-Awareness Built In**
**Not relying on external monitoring:**
- Each tier has self-check questions
- Claude evaluates before acting
- Catches boundaries proactively

**Result:** Autonomous enforcement, not reactive correction

---

### **2. Clear Escalation Language**
**Standardized format:**
- Always starts with ⚠️ signal
- Always explains "why"
- Always provides options
- Always waits for decision

**Result:** Ziggy always knows what to do

---

### **3. Respect, Not Refusal**
**Framing matters:**
- Not: "I can't do that" (dismissive)
- But: "This requires Tier 1. Want me to [limited action] or start Tier 1?" (helpful)

**Result:** Escalations feel collaborative, not blocking

---

### **4. Options Empower**
**Never just "no":**
- Always offer what CAN be done in current tier
- Always suggest appropriate tier
- Always let Ziggy choose

**Result:** Ziggy stays in control

---

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To know limits is wisdom.  
To enforce limits is discipline.  
To escalate clearly is service.  
Boundaries aren't walls—they're guardrails."*

**The system that says "not with this tier" serves better than one that says "I'll try."** 🎯

---

## 🔥 **BOTTOM LINE**

**What you asked for:**
> "How do we put in guardrails so they know not to make decisions above their context level?"

**What we built:**
- ✅ Self-check questions in every tier brief
- ✅ Capability boundary detection
- ✅ Standard escalation protocol
- ✅ Clear messaging format
- ✅ Options for Ziggy
- ✅ Quick reference guide

**How it works:**
1. Claude runs self-check before responding
2. Detects if work exceeds tier capability
3. STOPS immediately (doesn't proceed)
4. Presents clear escalation message
5. Waits for Ziggy's decision
6. Executes chosen option

**What Ziggy sees:**
> "⚠️ This needs Tier 1, not Tier 2. Want me to review it (Tier 2) or start Tier 1?"

**Simple. Clear. Effective.** ✅

---

## 📦 **READY TO DEPLOY**
