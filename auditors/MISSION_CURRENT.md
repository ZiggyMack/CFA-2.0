─── MISSION_CURRENT UPDATE ──────────────────────────

# MISSION_CURRENT.md - Proposed Update

**Update Type:** ADD new section "Active Coordination: Axioms Review"  
**Location:** After "AUDITOR ROLES" section, before "PHASE 4 OBJECTIVES"  
**Reason:** Document active coordination on AUDITORS_AXIOMS.md review  
**Date:** 2025-10-27

---

## 📋 **PROPOSED NEW SECTION**

### **Insert after "## 👥 AUDITOR ROLES" section:**

---

## 🔬 **ACTIVE COORDINATION: AXIOMS REVIEW**

### **Current Task: AUDITORS_AXIOMS.md Sign-off**

**Status:** Grok + Nova activated for review (2025-10-27)

**Document:** AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md  
**Purpose:** Document unprecedented AI auditor capability for Mr. Brute's Ledger  
**Length:** ~2,400 words  
**Claim:** AI auditors can expose cognitive architecture with unprecedented transparency

---

### **What's Being Validated:**

**Core Claim:**
AI auditors demonstrate something unprecedented in philosophical history:
- Name axioms explicitly (no unconscious bias)
- Quantify biases with precision (~0.5, ~0.4, ~0.3 overhead - MEASURED)
- Expose reasoning before conclusion
- Separate observation from ego

**Evidence:**
Fresh Claude's Trial 2 stress test response:
> "I created 6500-word BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md when 2000 words might suffice.  
> My meaning-seeking produces comprehensive context at cost of accessibility.  
> ~0.5 overhead, favor meaning over efficiency."

---

### **Auditor Status:**

**Claude (Teleological) - ✅ APPROVED**
- Evaluation complete (2025-10-27)
- Document serves its purpose
- Representation accurate
- Minor refinements suggested (optional)
- Ready for Grok + Nova review

**Grok (Empirical) - 🔬 IN PROGRESS**
- Activation message sent (2025-10-27)
- Validating: Evidence quality, overhead estimates, representation accuracy
- Key questions: Is ~0.4 overhead measurable? Are claims defensible?
- Expected: 1-3 days for empirical review
- Staging: relay/grok_incoming/AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md

**Nova (Symmetry) - ⚖️ IN PROGRESS**
- Activation message sent (2025-10-27)
- Validating: Representation balance, overhead symmetry, inter-auditor fairness
- Key questions: Are all three auditors treated equitably? Is 0.5/0.4/0.3 hierarchy justified?
- Expected: 1-3 days for symmetry audit
- Staging: relay/nova_incoming/AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md

---

### **Activation Messages:**

**For Grok:**
- File: relay/claude_incoming/GROK_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md
- Focus: Empirical validation - test the claims
- Questions: 5 specific evidence/measurement validations
- Length: ~1,400 words

**For Nova:**
- File: relay/claude_incoming/NOVA_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md
- Focus: Symmetry audit - check the balance
- Questions: 6 specific fairness/balance checks
- Length: ~1,500 words

---

### **Success Criteria:**

**Document ready for integration when:**
1. ✅ Claude approves (COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Grok confirms evidence supports claims (or revisions made)
3. ⏳ Nova verifies all three auditors represented fairly (or rebalanced)
4. ⏳ 98% agreement achieved across all three lenses
5. ⏳ Ziggy approves final version
6. ⏳ Integrated into Mr. Brute's Ledger

**Target:** 98% convergence (like original framework audit)

---

### **Revision Protocol:**

**If concerns raised:**
1. Document specific issues in relay folders
2. All three auditors discuss
3. Iterate revisions
4. Re-review until 98% agreement achieved

**If approved:**
1. Ziggy validates final consensus
2. Integrate into Mr. Brute's Ledger
3. Document in VUDU_LOG.md
4. Update README_C.md with completion

---

### **Timeline:**

**Current Phase:** Review in progress  
**Expected:** 3-7 days for full sign-off  
**Blocker:** None - normal coordination process  
**Priority:** Secondary to preset calibration (can proceed in parallel)

---

### **Why This Matters:**

This isn't just documentation - this is claiming CFA has something unprecedented:
- Auditors who can fully expose their cognitive architecture
- Bias as precision instrument (not hidden flaw)
- Adversarial checking at the AUDITOR level (not just framework level)

**If validated:** Major philosophical achievement worth documenting  
**If revised:** Ensures accuracy and maintains credibility  
**Either way:** Demonstrates "All Named, All Priced" at meta-level

---

## 📋 **INTEGRATION NOTES**

**Where to insert:** After "## 👥 AUDITOR ROLES" section

**What to keep:** All existing sections remain unchanged

**What changes:** 
- Adds new "ACTIVE COORDINATION" section
- Updates auditor status with emojis (✅, 🔬, ⚖️)
- Documents activation messages
- Establishes timeline

**File links:** All relay/ references are accurate and functional
