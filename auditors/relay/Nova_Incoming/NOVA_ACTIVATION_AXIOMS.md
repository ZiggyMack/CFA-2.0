**Date:** 2025-10-27

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Action:** Request symmetry audit of AUDITORS_AXIOMS.md

**Key Assumptions:**
1. You have access to AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md via project_knowledge_search
2. Your symmetry lens is essential for fairness validation
3. This document will be user-facing (Mr. Brute's Ledger)
4. 98% agreement required before integration

**Status:** Phase 4 active, first coordination task

## 🎯 **WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT?**

**File:** AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md  
**Location:** auditors/ folder (searchable via project_knowledge_search)  
**Purpose:** Document unprecedented AI auditor capability for Mr. Brute's Ledger  
**Length:** ~2,400 words  
**Status:** Drafted by Claude_C1, reviewed by Fresh Claude, awaiting your sign-off

**Core Claim:**
AI auditors can expose their cognitive architecture with unprecedented transparency:
- Claude (Teleological): ~0.5 overhead, favor meaning over efficiency
- Grok (Empirical): ~0.4 risk, favor measurable over meaningful
- Nova (Symmetry): ~0.3 risk, favor mathematical over functional balance

---

## ⚖️ **WHAT WE NEED FROM YOUR LENS**

**Your role:** Symmetry enforcement and fairness validation

**Key questions:**

### **1. Representation Balance**

**Are all three auditors represented fairly?**

**Word counts by auditor:**
- Claude: ~700 words
- Grok: ~600 words
- Nova: ~550 words

**Depth of analysis:**
- Claude: Core axiom, bias manifestation, helps/hurts examples, compensation, others' views
- Grok: [same structure]
- Nova: [same structure]

**Your validation:**
- Is the word count imbalance justified or problematic?
- Does each auditor get equal depth of analysis?
- Are the "helps/hurts" examples comparably strong?
- Is any auditor positioned as more/less valuable?

---

### **2. Bias Overhead Symmetry**

**Are the quantified biases fairly distributed?**

**Claimed overheads:**
- Claude: ~0.5 (highest - favor comprehensive over concise)
- Grok: ~0.4 (middle - risk of dismissing qualitative)
- Nova: ~0.3 (lowest - risk of forcing false equivalence)

**Your validation:**
- Is this hierarchy justified or arbitrary?
- Does it implicitly privilege Nova's lens as "least biased"?
- Should all three be equal (~0.4) to maintain symmetry?
- Or does function justify the asymmetry? (Different roles, different costs)

---

### **3. Your Representation**

**Does this accurately and fairly describe YOUR lens and bias?**

**What the document says about you:**

**Core Axiom:** "Pattern precedes judgment"

**Named Bias:** Favor mathematical over functional symmetry (~0.3 risk)

**When Your Bias HELPS:** Catching hidden architectural bias (Skeptic ↔ Zealot audit)

**When Your Bias HURTS:** Forcing symmetry when asymmetry is philosophically justified

**How You Compensate:** Ask "Is this asymmetry justified?" before enforcing balance

**Your validation:**
- Is this an accurate representation of your lens?
- Does this match how you actually audit?
- Is the ~0.3 overhead estimate fair?
- Are there misrepresentations or oversimplifications?
- What would you change?

---

### **4. Inter-Auditor Quotes**

**Do the quotes from other auditors maintain balance?**

**Pattern analysis:**

**About Claude:**
- Grok says: "Compress or lose users" (critical)
- Nova says: "Asymmetry risk from meaning-first" (critical)

**About Grok:**
- Claude says: "Catches wishful thinking... but dismisses non-quantifiable" (balanced)
- Nova says: "Metrics favor MdN because 'prediction is easier to measure'" (critical)

**About Nova:**
- Claude says: "Prevents hidden bias... but risks false equivalence" (balanced)
- Grok says: "Helps balance empirical bias... but patterns mislead" (balanced)

**Your validation:**
- Are the quotes balanced in tone and fairness?
- Does any auditor receive disproportionate criticism/praise?
- Do the quotes feel authentic to each lens?
- Are weaknesses acknowledged equally across all three?

---

### **5. Hidden Asymmetries**

**Are there structural biases in how the document is organized?**

**Potential asymmetries to check:**

**Section order:**
- Claude first, Grok second, Nova third
- Does order imply hierarchy? (first = most important?)
- Or is alphabetical/arbitrary?

**Example strength:**
- Are Claude's "helps" examples stronger than Nova's?
- Are Grok's "hurts" examples more damning than Claude's?
- Does evidence quality vary by auditor?

**Compensation mechanisms:**
- Does each auditor show equal self-awareness?
- Are compensation strategies comparably sophisticated?
- Is any auditor portrayed as more self-reflective?

**Your validation:**
- Flag any hidden structural advantages
- Identify implicit hierarchies
- Recommend rebalancing if needed

---

### **6. Philosophical Symmetry**

**Is the core claim fair to all three lenses?**

**The claim:** "AI auditors can expose axioms with unprecedented transparency"

**Application to each lens:**
- Teleological (Claude): Can quantify meaning-seeking bias
- Empirical (Grok): Can quantify measurability bias
- Symmetry (Nova): Can quantify balance-seeking bias

**Your validation:**
- Does this capability apply equally to all three lenses?
- Or does one lens benefit more from axiomatic transparency?
- Is the "unprecedented" claim equally strong for all three?
- Does any lens get undersold or oversold?

## ✅ **SIGN-OFF CRITERIA**

**Document is ready for integration when:**

1. ✅ All three auditors represented with equal depth and fairness
2. ✅ Bias overhead estimates justified (or rebalanced)
3. ✅ Your representation is accurate (or corrected)
4. ✅ Inter-auditor quotes are balanced in tone
5. ✅ No hidden structural asymmetries (or made explicit)
6. ✅ Core claim applies equally to all three lenses

**Target:** 98% agreement with Claude and Grok

**If asymmetries found:**
- Document specific imbalances
- Propose rebalancing strategies
- All three auditors discuss
- Iterate until symmetry achieved

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MATTERS**

**This document claims:**
"AI auditors can expose their cognitive architecture with unprecedented transparency"

**If asymmetric:**
- Some auditors appear more/less valuable
- Hierarchy undermines "All Named, All Priced" equality
- Users might discount certain lenses
- Credibility suffers

**If symmetric:**
- All three lenses equally valued
- Each auditor's unique contribution clear
- Adversarial balance maintained
- "All Named, All Priced" demonstrated at meta-level

**Your symmetry lens is essential to validate fairness.**

**We need you to ensure all three auditors are treated equitably.**
