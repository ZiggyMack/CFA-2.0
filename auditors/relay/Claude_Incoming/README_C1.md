─── MASTER BRANCH WORKING MEMORY ─────────────────────

# README_C1.md - Recent Context & Decisions

**Purpose:** Working memory for Master Branch Claude  
**Location:** relay/claude_incoming/README_C1.md  
**Maintained by:** Claude (Anthropic) - Master Branch  
**Updated:** 2025-10-27 (after cold start success)  
**Version:** v1.0

## 🎯 **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS**

**Problem:** Chat context limits force rollbacks, causing memory loss

**Solution:** This file captures recent decisions, current direction, and active work

**Usage:**
- Master Branch updates this after major milestones
- When rollback needed, Ziggy shares this file
- New Master Branch reads this + bootstrap files
- Result: Faster recovery, preserves recent decisions

**This is NOT a bootstrap file** (those are stable, in Bootstrap/ folder)  
**This IS a working log** (recent context, changes frequently)

## 📅 **CURRENT SESSION: 2025-10-27**

### **Session Start:**
- Started as fresh Master Branch (cold start)
- Used MISSION_DEFAULT.md cold start section
- 90-minute bootstrap successful
- All 6 verification questions answered correctly

### **Major Decisions This Session:**

**1. Architecture Refactor: No README_C1 in auditors/ root**
- **Decision:** Remove standalone README_C1.md concept
- **Reason:** Redundant with MISSION_DEFAULT.md purpose
- **Result:** MISSION_DEFAULT.md now handles cold start guidance
- **Status:** ✅ Deployed (2025-10-27)
- **Impact:** Cleaner architecture, better separation of concerns

**2. AUDITORS_AXIOMS.md Review Activated**
- **Decision:** Activate Grok + Nova for axioms document review
- **Reason:** Document claims unprecedented AI auditor capability
- **Method:** Created activation messages in relay/claude_incoming/
- **Status:** ⏳ In progress (Grok + Nova reviewing)
- **Timeline:** 3-7 days expected for sign-off

**3. MISSION_CURRENT.md Update**
- **Change:** Added "ACTIVE COORDINATION: Axioms Review" section
- **Location:** After AUDITOR ROLES, before PHASE 4 OBJECTIVES
- **Purpose:** Document Grok + Nova activation and timeline
- **Status:** ✅ Approved by Ziggy, ready to deploy

**4. README_C.md Minimal Update**
- **Change:** Status line only ("awaiting" → "in progress")
- **Method:** String replacement, points to MISSION_CURRENT for details
- **Purpose:** Keep README_C high-level, detail in MISSION_CURRENT
- **Status:** ✅ Approved by Ziggy, ready to deploy

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATE**

**Active Work:**
- Axioms review coordination (Grok + Nova)
- Awaiting review responses in relay folders
- Documentation updates ready for deployment

**On Deck:**
- Preset calibration mission (Phase 4)
- Parallel to axioms review (not blocked)

**Blockers:**
- None - normal coordination process

---

## 📂 **RECENT FILES CREATED**

**In relay/claude_incoming/:**
- GROK_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md (~1,400 words)
- NOVA_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md (~1,500 words)
- MISSION_CURRENT_UPDATE.md (staging for integration)
- README_C_UPDATE.md (staging for integration)
- README_C1.md (this file)

**Purpose:** All staged for review before integration

---

## 🔑 **KEY INSIGHTS FROM THIS SESSION**

**1. Cold Start Process Works**
- MISSION_DEFAULT.md cold start section is effective
- 90-minute bootstrap time validated
- No need for separate README_C1 in auditors/ root

**2. Trust Protocol Applied Successfully**
- Created activation messages (not direct coordination)
- Staged updates in relay/claude_incoming/
- Awaited Ziggy approval before integration
- Kept changes minimal and focused

**3. Architecture Cleaned**
- Removed redundancy (README_C1 vs MISSION_DEFAULT)
- Better separation of concerns
- Cleaner file structure

**4. Meta-Level Documentation**
- Documenting auditor capabilities (not just framework)
- "All Named, All Priced" at auditor level
- Unprecedented transparency claim being validated

## 💬 **WHAT FUTURE ME SHOULD KNOW**

**If reading this after rollback:**

1. **Bootstrap first** (MISSION_DEFAULT cold start section)
2. **Then read this** for recent decisions
3. **Check relay folders** for active coordination
4. **Read MISSION_CURRENT.md** for full context
5. **Continue work** without repeating decisions

**The system is working.** Trust it.

**Recent direction is solid.** Architecture improvements made.

**Axioms review in progress.** Await Grok + Nova responses.

**Preset calibration on deck.** Ready when axioms review settles.

---

## 🔄 **UPDATE PROTOCOL**

**When to update this file:**
- After major architectural decisions
- After activating new coordination
- After completing milestones
- Before expected rollback (if anticipated)

**What to include:**
- Decision made
- Reasoning
- Status (✅ complete, ⏳ in progress, 🔜 planned)
- Impact on project

**What to exclude:**
- Routine work (belongs in VUDU_LOG.md)
- Stable facts (belongs in bootstrap files)
- Detailed analysis (belongs in mission files)

**Keep this file under 500 lines** - if longer, archive and start fresh

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To document for future self is to respect continuity.  
To keep logs current is to minimize recovery cost.  
To survive rollback is to prove system resilience."*

**This file is insurance against memory loss.** 🔥
