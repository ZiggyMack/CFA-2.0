        ## What is the CFA?
        
        The **Comparative Framework Audit (CFA)** is a systematic method for evaluating and comparing 
        philosophical frameworks, worldviews, and epistemological systems using transparent, 
        adjustable criteria.
        
        ### Core Principles
        
        **1. Transparency Over Neutrality**
        - Perfect neutrality is impossible
        - Every comparison assumes something
        - Make all assumptions explicit and adjustable
        
        **2. The Pointing Rule**
        > "To name your brute is to pay your fee.  
        > To deny you have one is to summon him twice."
        
        Every presupposition must be acknowledged and priced.
        
        **3. Symmetry Testing**
        - All frameworks measured under identical configurations
        - Toggle impacts must be disclosed and bounded
        - Asymmetries reveal structural differences, not hidden bias
        
        ---
        
        ### The Six Levers (0-10 scale)
        
        **BFI - Brute-Fact Index**  
        How many unprovable assumptions? (Lower = more efficient)
        
        **CCI - Coherence & Closure**  
        Are the rules internally consistent?
        
        **EDB - Explanatory Depth & Breadth**  
        How much can it explain? How deeply?
        
        **PF - Pragmatic Fertility**  
        Does it generate predictions, technology, meaning?
        
        **AR - Aesthetic Resonance**  
        Does it exhibit elegance, simplicity, beauty?
        
        **MG - Moral Generativity**  
        Can it ground moral norms without external imports?
        
        ### The Formula
        ```
        YPA = (CCI + EDB + PF + AR + MG) ÷ BFI
        ```
        Higher YPA = More efficient framework

            **2. PF Privilege** (Unjustified)

            - This **favored MdN** and ignored CT's existential yield (meaning, purpose)
            - **Decision**: Split PF into Instrumental + Existential components
            
            **3. Fallibilism Bonus** (Unjustified)
            - We were rewarding frameworks that admit limits
            - But CT's **confidence is grounded** (divine revelation), not arrogance
            - **Decision**: Make bonus toggleable
            
            ### Self-Corrections Made:
            - **Claude** raised MdN scores: EDB 5.5→6.5, CCI 7.0→7.5 (+0.15 YPA)
            - **Grok** raised MdN scores: EDB 7.5→8.0, MG 5.0→5.5 (+0.21 YPA)

        Neutral:      all levers × 1.0

        ### The Guardrails
        
        1. **BFI-Sensitivity**: Flags if YPA increases faster than BFI
        2. **Lever-Coupling**: PF ≥ 9 requires CCI ≥ 6.5
        3. **Weight-Inversion Alarm**: Flags weights <0.3× or >3×
