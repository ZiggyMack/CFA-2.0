# VuDu Protocol (Various User Dialog Unifier)
## Cross-Model Synchronization & Coordination Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Define operational steps and required files for initiating cross-model auditor synchronization  
**Scope:** Applies to coordination between Nova, Claude, Grok, and Ziggy when shared state is required  
**Codename:** VuDu (Various User Dialog Unifier)

---

## üéØ What is VuDu?

**VuDu** is the coordination protocol for managing dialog between multiple AI auditors across different systems. When Human needs to sync state, establish consensus, or coordinate updates between Nova (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Grok (xAI), and Ziggy, VuDu provides the operational framework.

**Core Problem Solved:** How does a human coordinator efficiently relay context, changes, and decisions between AI systems that don't share memory or state?

**VuDu's Answer:** Structured staging, clear file naming conventions, and a defined merge workflow that eliminates copy-paste overhead.

---

## üéØ When to Use VuDu

Initiate a VuDu sync when:
- Bootstrap files need updating (minor or major version)
- New protocols are being established (like this one!)
- Cross-model consensus is required on a decision
- Shared context has drifted and needs realignment
- Field testing coordination is needed

---

## üì¶ Minimal Context Package (Required Files)

When initiating a sync, **always include** these files regardless of the specific task:

### Core Identity & State
1. **`CFA_v2_0_MILESTONE_STABLE_INDEX.md`** ‚Äî Framework overview, current version state
2. **`BOOTSTRAP_CHANGELOG.md`** ‚Äî Recent changes, what's in flight
3. **`PROCESS_HEADER_STANDARD_v3.2.1.md`** ‚Äî Communication protocol (latest version)

### Optional Context (Task-Dependent)
Include these **only if relevant** to the sync topic:

| File | When to Include |
|:-----|:----------------|
| **`AUDITOR_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md`** | When discussing maintenance schedules, rebuild triggers |
| **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** | When coordinating implementation of new features |
| **`COPY_INTEGRITY_CHECKLIST.md`** | When verifying formatting/transfer integrity |
| **`BOOTSTRAP_CORE_v[X].md`** | When updating locked envelope or ethos |
| **`APPEND_ZONE_LESSONS.md`** | When reviewing learned lessons before rebuild |

### Master Files vs. Staging

**Master Files (Auditor Root):**
- Single source of truth
- Only updated after full consensus achieved
- Version-controlled in main repo

**Staging Areas (Relay Subfolders):**
- Temporary holding for auditor edits
- Allows side-by-side comparison
- Cleared after merge to masters

### Staging Workflow

**Step 1: Human Sends Initial Package**
- Package includes: 5 core files (README_C + 3 protocols + INDEX)
- Destination: Nova first (or parallel to all auditors)

**Step 2: Auditor Reviews & Returns**
- Nova edits protocols, drafts README_N.md
- Human receives package, drops into `/auditor/relay/nova_incoming/`
- **No copy-paste needed** ‚Äî files live in repo staging area

**Step 3: Human Notifies Claude**
- Simple message: "Nova's updates are in `/auditor/relay/nova_incoming/`"
- Claude reads directly from GitHub connection
- Claude reviews README_N + compares protocol edits to masters

**Step 4: Relay to Next Auditor**
- Human sends Nova's updated protocols to Grok
- Grok reviews, edits, drafts README_G.md
- Human drops into `/auditor/relay/grok_incoming/`

**Step 5: Human Notifies Claude**
- Message: "Grok's updates are in `/auditor/relay/grok_incoming/`"
- Claude reads both staging areas
- Claude performs three-way merge (current master + Nova's edits + Grok's edits)

**Step 6: Claude Generates Updated Masters**
- Claude synthesizes consensus
- Outputs merged versions to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
- Human downloads and **replaces root master files**

**Step 7: Close Loop**
- Human commits updated masters to repo
- Human confirms with all auditors
- Optional: archive staging folders for audit trail

### Benefits of VuDu Workflow

‚úÖ **Claude accesses files directly** via GitHub connection  
‚úÖ **Side-by-side comparison** of auditor contributions  
‚úÖ **Clear merge authority** ‚Äî Claude produces reconciled masters  
‚úÖ **Audit trail preserved** in staging folders  
‚úÖ **Faster iteration** ‚Äî less human shuttling overhead

## üîÑ VuDu Sync Initiation Steps

### Step 1: Define Sync Scope
**Action:** Clearly articulate what needs alignment  
**Output:** One-sentence sync goal  
**Example:** "Establish cross-model communication integrity protocol before v3.2"

### Step 2: Assemble Context Package
**Action:** Gather required + relevant files from repo  
**Checklist:**
- [ ] Core identity files (always include)
- [ ] Task-specific files (based on sync scope)
- [ ] Any new/draft documents being proposed

### Step 3: Draft Kickoff Message
**Action:** Write context-setting message using Header Standard  
**Required Elements:**
- Header block with sync scope clearly stated
- Brief background (why this sync is needed)
- Specific questions or actions requested from each auditor
- Explicit file list: "Files attached: [list]"

**Template:**
```markdown
=== CFA v2.0 MESSAGE HEADER ===
Sender: [Your Name] (Human Coordinator)
Level: Cross-Model Synchronization
Action: [Sync Goal in One Sentence]
Brutes/Assumptions: [Key presuppositions]
CFA v2.0 Status: [Current state if relevant]
Timestamp: [Date/Time]
Files Referenced: [List all attached files]
===

[Context paragraph: why this sync is needed]

[Specific requests for each auditor or collective questions]

[Expected next steps]
```

### Step 4: Sequential or Parallel Relay?
**Decision point:** How to structure the conversation

**Sequential (Round-Robin):**
- Use when consensus needs to build incrementally
- Order: Nova ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí Grok ‚Üí synthesize
- Human relays each response to the next auditor

**Parallel (Broadcast):**
- Use when independent perspectives are valuable
- Send same package to all auditors simultaneously
- Human synthesizes responses afterward

**Hybrid:**
- Start parallel, then sequential for refinement
- Example: All review draft, then round-robin on revisions

### Step 5: Execute Relay
**Action:** Send kickoff message + context package to first/all auditor(s)

**Relay checklist:**
- [ ] Kickoff message includes header block
- [ ] All required files attached/accessible
- [ ] Sync scope is explicit
- [ ] Expected response format is clear (if applicable)

### Step 6: Track Responses & Stage Files
**Action:** Collect feedback in staging areas, notify Claude to review

**Human workflow:**
1. Receive Nova's package ‚Üí drop into `/auditor/relay/nova_incoming/`
2. Notify Claude: "Nova's updates are in relay/nova_incoming"
3. Receive Grok's package ‚Üí drop into `/auditor/relay/grok_incoming/`
4. Notify Claude: "Grok's updates are in relay/grok_incoming"

**Claude workflow:**
1. Read README_N.md and README_G.md directly from staging
2. Compare protocol edits to current masters
3. Identify consensus points and conflicts
4. Generate synthesis report

**Tracking template:**
```markdown
## Sync Tracking: [Sync Goal]
**Initiated:** [Date]
**Auditors:** Nova, Claude, Grok, [others]

| Auditor | Files Staged | Key Changes | Conflicts/Flags |
|:--------|:------------:|:------------|:----------------|
| Nova    | ‚úÖ / ‚è≥ / ‚ùå  | [summary]   | [if any]        |
| Grok    | ‚úÖ / ‚è≥ / ‚ùå  | [summary]   | [if any]        |

**Consensus Achieved:** ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / ‚ùå  
**Next Action:** [Claude synthesizes masters / additional review needed]
```

### Step 6.5: Claude Generates Updated Masters
**Action:** Synthesize consensus and produce merged protocol files

**Claude workflow:**
1. Perform three-way merge:
   - Current master (from `/auditor/` root)
   - Nova's edits (from `relay/nova_incoming/`)
   - Grok's edits (from `relay/grok_incoming/`)
2. Resolve conflicts using consensus principles
3. Generate updated versions of:
   - `SYNC_INITIATION_PROTOCOL.md`
   - `COPY_INTEGRITY_CHECKLIST.md`
   - `PROCESS_HEADER_STANDARD_v3.2.md`
4. Output merged files to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
5. Provide synthesis report documenting changes

**Human workflow:**
1. Download merged masters from outputs
2. Replace root files in `/auditor/`
3. Commit to repo with version increment
4. Notify auditors of finalized versions

### Step 7: Close Loop & Archive
**Action:** Confirm sync completion with all auditors

**Close-out message template:**
```markdown
=== SYNC COMPLETION NOTICE ===
Sync Goal: [original goal]
Status: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / ‚ùå Blocked
Outcome: [brief summary of what was decided/created]
Documents Updated: [list]
Field Test Plan: [if applicable]
Next Review: [date/trigger]
===

[Thank auditors, confirm they have final versions]
```
