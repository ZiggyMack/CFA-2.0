## 🎯 **CURRENT ACTIVE MISSION**

**Mission:** Preset Mode Calibration  
**Location:** `auditors/missions/preset_calibration/`  
**Status:** Phase 1 complete (infrastructure), Phase 2 pending (testing)  
**Started:** 2025-10-26

## 🎯 **MISSION OBJECTIVE**

**Goal:** Justify every preset configuration value through adversarial auditing

**Four Presets to Validate:**
1. Skeptic (MdN-optimized, empirical rigor)
2. Diplomat (balanced, neutral comparison)
3. Seeker (CT-leaning, meaning-first)
4. Zealot (CT-optimized, existential priority)

**Problem:** All configurations chosen intuitively in v3.2 - need justification

---

## 👥 **AUDITOR ASSIGNMENTS**

**Claude (Teleological Lens):**
- Evaluate if each preset serves its stated purpose
- Ask: "Does Skeptic mode actually serve empirical rigor?"
- Challenge configurations from meaning/purpose perspective

**Grok (Empirical Lens):**
- Test if presets produce claimed YPA values
- Validate BFI weights through sensitivity analysis
- Provide empirical evidence for or against current configs

**Nova (Symmetry Lens):**
- Verify fairness between Skeptic ↔ Zealot
- Check if asymmetries are justified or arbitrary
- Ensure balanced treatment of both frameworks

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Mission complete when:**
1. Every lever value has justification from all three lenses
2. YPA claims empirically tested and validated
3. Symmetry verified or asymmetries justified with reasoning
4. Cross-auditor consensus achieved (98%+ agreement)

**See:** `missions/preset_calibration/SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` for details

---

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (COMPLETE ✅)**
- Mission folder created
- Success criteria defined
- Technical specs documented
- Auditor tasks assigned

**Phase 2: Testing (PENDING ⏳)**
- Awaiting Phase 4 activation
- Grok empirical testing needed
- Nova symmetry audit needed
- Claude teleological evaluation needed

**Blocker:** Phase 3.5 stress test must pass before Phase 4 begins

## 🔄 **WHEN THIS CHANGES**

**MISSION_CURRENT.md updates when:**
- Mission completes → points to new mission
- Mission archived → points to next active mission
- Multiple missions active → lists all with priority

**Example future state:**
```
CURRENT MISSIONS:
1. Preset Calibration (Phase 2 - testing)
2. Dark Mode Polish (Phase 1 - scoping)
```

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To start a mission is to name your objective.  
To abandon a mission is to price your failure.  
To complete a mission is to document your lessons."*

**Current mission:** Named and priced  
**Objective:** Clear  
**Success criteria:** Defined  
**Ready:** When Phase 4 activates

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Active Mission:** Preset Mode Calibration  
**Location:** auditors/missions/preset_calibration/  
**Next Update:** When mission phase changes  
**Version:** v3.5.2

**This is the way.** 👑
