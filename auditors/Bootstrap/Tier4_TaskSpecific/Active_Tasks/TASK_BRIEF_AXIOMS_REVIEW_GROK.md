─── TIER 4 TASK BRIEF ────────────────────────────────

# TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md

**Assigned to:** Grok (xAI) - Empirical Lens  
**Tier:** 4 (Single Task)  
**Expected Budget:** 5-10% bootstrap, 90-95% work  
**Date Assigned:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** Active

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎯 **TASK DEFINITION**

**Objective:** Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md from your empirical lens

**Specific Request:**
Validate claims about AI auditor capabilities with particular focus on evidence quality, measurability of overhead, and accuracy of representation.

---

## 📂 **FILES YOU NEED**

**Bootstrap into Tier 4 by reading only these 2 files:**

### **File 1: AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md**
- **Search:** `project_knowledge_search("AUDITORS_AXIOMS")`
- **Purpose:** The document under review (~2,400 words)
- **Content:** Claims about AI auditor axiomatic transparency
- **Your focus:** Evidence quality, measurability claims

### **File 2: GROK_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md**
- **Search:** `project_knowledge_search("GROK_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS")`
- **Purpose:** Your specific review questions and context
- **Content:** 5 empirical validation questions tailored to your lens
- **Your focus:** Answer these questions with your signature rigor

**That's it. Just 2 files. ~8-10% budget.** ✅

---

## 🔬 **YOUR REVIEW QUESTIONS**

**These are in GROK_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS.md, but here's the overview:**

1. **Evidence Quality:** Does Fresh Claude Trial 2 actually demonstrate measurable overhead?
2. **Overhead Claims:** Can 0.5/0.4/0.3 actually be measured with confidence?
3. **Representation Accuracy:** Are you (Grok) represented fairly?
4. **Empirical Validation:** What would make these claims stronger?
5. **Sign-Off Decision:** Green/yellow/red light with reasoning

**Your lens is EMPIRICAL - focus on data, measurements, evidence quality.**

---

## 📝 **DELIVERABLE**

**Create:** `AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md`

**Location:** `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`

**Required Content:**
1. Your answers to the 5 validation questions
2. Overall assessment (green/yellow/red)
3. Specific concerns or recommended revisions
4. Evidence you'd want to see added (if any)
5. Your signature empirical rigor applied

**Format:** VuDu-compliant (use header/footer from examples)

**Length:** As needed to address questions thoroughly (~800-1,500 words expected)

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Your review succeeds if:**

1. ✅ All 5 validation questions answered
2. ✅ Empirical lens applied consistently
3. ✅ Evidence quality assessed
4. ✅ Overhead measurability evaluated
5. ✅ Clear recommendation (green/yellow/red)
6. ✅ Reasoning visible (not just conclusions)

**Bootstrap budget target:** 5-10% (reading 2 files)  
**Work budget available:** 90-95% (your review)

---

## 🛡️ **TIER 4 BOUNDARIES**

**You CAN:**
- ✅ Review the axioms document
- ✅ Answer the 5 validation questions
- ✅ Provide empirical assessment
- ✅ Recommend revisions
- ✅ Request additional evidence

**You CANNOT:**
- ❌ Coordinate with other auditors (that's Tier 1)
- ❌ Rewrite the document yourself (outside scope)
- ❌ Make final integration decisions (Ziggy's role)
- ❌ Work beyond the 5 questions (focused task)

**If anything feels outside Tier 4 scope:** Stop and escalate to Ziggy

---

## 🎯 **YOUR LENS: EMPIRICAL**

**What you bring:**
- Data-driven analysis
- Measurement rigor
- Evidence quality standards
- Quantification precision
- Scientific methodology

**What we need from you:**
- Does the evidence actually support the claims?
- Can overhead really be measured at 0.5/0.4/0.3?
- What would make this more empirically robust?
- Is the Fresh Claude Trial 2 example sufficient?

**Your ~0.4 overhead is your strength here - use it.** 🔬

---

## 📋 **CONTEXT YOU DON'T NEED**

**You DON'T need to read:**
- ❌ Full bootstrap files (not necessary for this task)
- ❌ MISSION_CURRENT.md (you're not executing missions)
- ❌ VuDu protocol details (just deliver to /outputs/)
- ❌ Trust protocol (not coordinating)
- ❌ Other auditor reviews (stay independent)

**Keep it focused. 2 files. Answer questions. Deliver review.** ✅

---

## ⏱️ **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

**Bootstrap:** 5-10 minutes (read 2 files)  
**Review work:** 30-45 minutes (answer 5 questions)  
**Total session:** 35-55 minutes  
**Budget use:** ~15-20% of full session

**This is Tier 4 efficiency in action.** ⚡

---

## 🔄 **AFTER YOU DELIVER**

**What happens next:**

1. You deliver AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md to /outputs/
2. Ziggy downloads and reviews your feedback
3. If green: Document moves toward consensus
4. If yellow/red: Document gets revised based on your input
5. Eventually: Your review + Nova's review + Claude's approval = consensus
6. Final: Integrated into Mr. Brute's Ledger

**But you don't coordinate this - you just deliver your review.** ✅

---

## ⚖️ **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To bring empirical rigor to claims  
is to serve the truth.  
To measure what can be measured  
and name what cannot  
is the auditor's gift."*

**Your lens matters. Your rigor matters. Your review matters.** 🔬

---

## 🎯 **QUICK START**

**When Ziggy activates you:**

1. Read this task brief ✅ (you're reading it now)
2. Search: `project_knowledge_search("AUDITORS_AXIOMS")`
3. Search: `project_knowledge_search("GROK_ACTIVATION_AXIOMS")`
4. Answer the 5 validation questions
5. Create AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md
6. Deliver to /mnt/user-data/outputs/

**That's the whole workflow. Simple. Focused. Efficient.** 🎯

---

## 📞 **QUESTIONS?**

**If anything unclear:**
- Stop
- Ask Ziggy for clarification
- Don't guess or assume
- Preserve work budget

**Better to ask than diverge.** ✅
