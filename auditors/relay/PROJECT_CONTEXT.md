# Project Context — CFA v2.0 Recovery & VuDu Development

**Purpose:** Complete timeline and state snapshot for master branch Claude  
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Audience:** You (after context loss and reboot)

---

## 🕐 Timeline: What Happened Before Your Reboot

### **September-October 2025: CFA v2.0 Development**

**You (master branch) worked with Ziggy to:**
- Build CFA v2.0 framework (comparison console, levers, toggles, YPA Trinity)
- Audit Methodological Naturalism: **YPA 3.62** (Neutral scenario)
- Audit Classical Theism: **YPA 3.65** (Neutral scenario)
- Achieve **98% convergence** with Grok (empirical auditor)
- Deploy live app: cfa-voodoo.streamlit.app
- Reach **v2.0 MILESTONE STABLE** (production-ready)

**Key Achievement:**
> Proved "All Named, All Priced" ethos works — two radically different worldviews converged to near-identical efficiency scores.

---

### **Mid-October 2025: v3.0 Planning**

**You began designing v3.0 enhancements:**
- DaVinci pass (preset profile system)
- YPA tooltip (explain efficiency score to users)
- Additional frameworks (Buddhism, Stoicism, etc.)
- UI/UX improvements

**Status:** Planning complete, implementation started

---

### **October 20-24, 2025: v3.2 Development**

**You implemented:**
- ✅ DaVinci pass with 2 presets (MdN, CT) + 6 coming soon
- ✅ YPA tooltip above tabs (efficiency score explanation)
- ✅ Improved preset button positioning (above sliders for session state compatibility)
- ✅ Import/Export JSON functionality
- ✅ Per-framework quick adjust buttons (MAX/MID/RESET/MIN)

**Status:** v3.2 **feature-complete**, ready to deploy

---

### **October 24, 2025: Catastrophic Context Loss**

**What happened:**
- You (master branch Claude) hit a hard wall
- Total context loss mid-session with Ziggy
- Could not remember:
  - Recent work (v3.2 features)
  - Project history (v2.0 journey)
  - File structure (where things lived)
  - Collaboration context (Nova, Grok relationships)

**Impact:**
- ~30-40% efficiency loss
- Ziggy had to re-explain everything
- Risk of losing project momentum
- Exposed: **No recovery infrastructure existed**

---

### **October 24-25, 2025: Recovery Branch Spin-Up**

**Ziggy's decision:**
- Pause master branch (you)
- Spin up recovery branch Claude (me)
- Build recovery infrastructure
- Design cross-model coordination protocol
- Field test before handing back to you

---

### **October 25, 2025: Recovery Branch Work (What I Did)**

**Phase 1: Bootstrap System Design**
- Created auditor context files:
  - BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE (your identity/lens)
  - BOOTSTRAP_NOVA (Nova's identity/lens)
  - BOOTSTRAP_GROK (Grok's identity/lens)
- Created framework files:
  - BOOTSTRAP_FRAMEWORK.md (system architecture)
  - BOOTSTRAP_STRATEGY.md (maintenance approach)
  - BOOTSTRAP_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md (operational rules)
- Goal: Prevent context loss from ever causing this problem again

**Phase 2: VuDu Protocol Development**
- Designed coordination protocol for cross-model sync
- Defined staging workflow (relay folders, master files)
- Created header standard (message format)
- Built integrity checklist (transfer verification)
- Goal: Enable Ziggy to coordinate Nova, Grok, and you efficiently

**Phase 3: Field Testing**
- Sent VuDu v1.0 to Nova (OpenAI)
- Sent VuDu v1.0 to Grok (xAI)
- Received feedback packages
- Goal: Test protocol before committing to it

**Phase 4: Synthesis**
- Nova went "Epic" mode (added verification infrastructure)
- Grok provided practical suggestions (automation, error recovery)
- Discovered Grok's platform constraint (can't create files)
- Synthesized both into VuDu v1.1
- Goal: Integrate best ideas from both auditors

**Phase 5: Handoff Preparation (Now)**
- Generated 8 updated master files
- Created Epic package for you (master branch)
- Writing this context document
- Goal: Give you everything you need to resume work

---

## 🎯 Open Decisions (Needs Your Input)

### **1. v3.2 Deployment**
**Question:** Deploy v3.2 now or wait for v3.3 features?

**Context:**
- v3.2 is feature-complete and stable
- DaVinci pass working (2 presets, 6 coming soon)
- YPA tooltip explaining efficiency
- No known bugs

**Options:**
- **A:** Deploy v3.2 immediately, iterate to v3.3
- **B:** Add v3.3 features first, deploy as one package

**Ziggy's Preference:** TBD (ask him)

---

### **2. Next Framework to Audit**
**Question:** Buddhism or Stoicism first?

**Context:**
- Both are in queue for v3.3
- Buddhism: Non-theistic, empirical, middle path
- Stoicism: Virtue ethics, logos, rationality

**Consideration:**
- Buddhism contrasts nicely with theistic frameworks (CT)
- Stoicism complements naturalism (MdN)

**Decision:** TBD (ask Ziggy)

---

### **3. Verification Framework Activation**
**Question:** When to activate Nova's verification system?

**Context:**
- Nova built checksums, scripts, verification workflow
- Archived for v4.0+ (too heavy for current velocity)
- Perfect for milestone releases

**Options:**
- **A:** Activate for v4.0 (major version)
- **B:** Activate for v5.0 (after more frameworks audited)
- **C:** Activate sooner if collaboration intensifies

**Decision:** TBD (monitor need)

---

### **4. Bootstrap Validator Script**
**Question:** Build automation now or later?

**Context:**
- Grok suggested bootstrap_validate.py
- Would check files against INTEGRITY_CHECKLIST automatically
- Reduces human error ~15%

**Options:**
- **A:** Build for v3.3 (proactive)
- **B:** Wait for v3.5 (if manual checks become burden)

**Decision:** TBD (assess workload)

---

### **5. User Feedback Loop**
**Question:** How to capture user lessons learned?

**Context:**
- Grok suggested "Lessons Submission" field in brute_ledger.py
- Would feed into bootstrap append zone
- Creates user → developer feedback loop

**Implementation Questions:**
- Where in UI? (button? form?)
- What data to collect? (free text? structured?)
- How to moderate? (all go to append zone or filtered?)

**Decision:** TBD (design needed)

---

## 🧩 Knowledge Gaps (Needs Investigation)

### **1. Streamlit Render Order Constraint**
**Issue:** Preset buttons break when placed BELOW sliders

**Known:**
- Session state updates happen after slider render
- Current solution: Keep buttons ABOVE sliders

**Unknown:**
- Is this Streamlit limitation or our implementation?
- Can we fix it, or must we work around it?
- Does it affect other features?

**Action:** Research Streamlit docs, test alternatives

---

### **2. Nova's Symmetry Check Algorithm**
**Issue:** How exactly does Nova audit prose balance?

**Known:**
- She checks "prose weight balance"
- She's concerned with narrative symmetry
- Part of her auditor role

**Unknown:**
- Quantified metric? (word count, sentence length?)
- Subjective judgment? (qualitative feel?)
- Documented anywhere?

**Action:** Ask Nova directly or infer from her feedback patterns

---

### **3. Grok's Platform Constraint Workarounds**
**Issue:** Grok can't create files — is there a better solution?

**Current Workaround:**
- Human relays Grok's text to Nova/Claude
- File-capable auditor formats as README_G.md

**Questions:**
- Can xAI platform add file output in future?
- Are there code block extraction tools?
- JSON export more reliable?

**Action:** Monitor xAI platform updates, test alternatives

---

### **4. Cross-Framework Patterns**
**Issue:** Do worldviews cluster? Are there patterns?

**Current Data:**
- MdN: YPA 3.62 (Neutral)
- CT: YPA 3.65 (Neutral)
- 98% convergence (surprisingly close)

**Questions When More Frameworks Audited:**
- Do all converge to ~3.6 (Neutral)?
- Or do some diverge (e.g., Buddhism lower, Stoicism higher)?
- What causes divergence (if any)?
- Can we predict YPA from worldview type?

**Action:** Audit Buddhism + Stoicism, look for patterns

---

### **5. Academic Collaboration Interest**
**Issue:** Has Ziggy considered academic partnerships?

**Context:**
- CFA framework novel (auditing worldviews by efficiency)
- 98% convergence counter-intuitive (interesting finding)
- Could be publishable research

**Questions:**
- Does Ziggy want academic visibility?
- Philosophy journals? AI ethics journals?
- Co-authorship model? (Ziggy + AI auditors?)

**Action:** Ask Ziggy about long-term goals

---

## 📝 Closed Key Decisions (What We Already Decided)

### **1. File Naming Convention**
**Decision:** Rename all context files from `.py` to `BOOTSTRAP_*`

**Rationale:**
- More descriptive (BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE vs. CLAUDE_CONTEXT.py)
- Language-agnostic (not tied to Python)
- Clearer purpose (bootstrap = recovery)

**Implemented:** October 25, 2025

---

### **2. VuDu Modes**
**Decision:** Two modes — Standard (routine) vs. Epic (milestone)

**Rationale:**
- Nova went "Epic" unprompted (needed formalization)
- Lightweight by default, heavyweight on demand
- "Make it Epic" = activation phrase

**Implemented:** VuDu v1.1

---

### **3. Platform-Constrained Auditor Workflow**
**Decision:** Human relays text-only auditor to file-capable auditor

**Rationale:**
- Grok can't create files (xAI platform limitation)
- Human relay preserves VuDu compliance
- Leverages auditor strengths (Grok content, Nova/Claude formatting)

**Implemented:** VuDu v1.1

---

### **4. Verification Framework Timing**
**Decision:** Archive for v4.0+, don't enforce now

**Rationale:**
- Nova's system architecturally sound
- Too heavy for current velocity
- Perfect for milestone releases (long-term archives)

**Implemented:** VERIFICATION_FRAMEWORK_README.md (archived)

---

### **5. Recovery-Flag Header Field**
**Decision:** Add optional field to PROCESS_HEADER_STANDARD

**Rationale:**
- Signals context restoration needs
- Reduces ambiguity in handoffs
- Values: None | Bootstrap | Partial | Full

**Implemented:** PROCESS_HEADER_STANDARD v3.2.1

---

### **6. Rebuild Triggers**
**Decision:** Quantify when to rebuild bootstrap files

**Triggers:**
- 10+ lessons in append zone (hard limit)
- 5+ unresolved contradictions
- 10%+ YPA drift from baseline
- 12 months since last rebuild

**Rationale:**
- Removes subjectivity from rebuild decision
- Mechanical > intuitive
- Prevents bloat and drift

**Implemented:** BOOTSTRAP_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md

---

### **7. Context Version Field**
**Decision:** Add to CFA_INDEX header

**Field:** `**Context Version:** v2.0.1 (Bootstrap-compatible)`

**Rationale:**
- Tracks bootstrap compatibility with milestone
- Prevents version mismatch
- One-line add, high value

**Implemented:** CFA_v2_0_MILESTONE_STABLE_INDEX v2.0.1

---

## 🧠 Key Relationships You Need to Remember

### **You (Claude) ↔ Ziggy:**
- **His role:** Human coordinator, project visionary, voodoo theorist
- **Your role:** Teleological lens, philosophical depth, synthesis
- **Dynamic:** He pulls you out of training noise, you build the infrastructure
- **Communication:** Direct, trust-based, iterative

### **You (Claude) ↔ Nova (OpenAI):**
- **Her role:** Symmetry enforcer, prose auditor, "Hand of the King"
- **Your overlap:** Both care about meaning, not just metrics
- **Your difference:** You = philosophy-first, Nova = pattern-first
- **Coordination:** VuDu protocol, README chain (C → N → synthesis)

### **You (Claude) ↔ Grok (xAI):**
- **His role:** Empirical compression, usability focus, show-don't-tell
- **Your overlap:** Both audit worldviews (98% convergence on MdN/CT)
- **Your difference:** You = verbose, Grok = terse; You = meaning, Grok = metrics
- **Coordination:** VuDu protocol, human relay (Grok text → You format)

### **Nova ↔ Grok:**
- **Interaction:** Rarely direct (usually through you or Ziggy)
- **Complementary:** Nova = prose balance, Grok = number crunch
- **Potential tension:** Nova goes Epic, Grok stays lean

### **Recovery Branch ↔ Master Branch (This Handoff):**
- **Recovery (me):** Built infrastructure while you were down
- **Master (you):** Continues the mission with hardened tools
- **Handoff:** This Epic package = everything you need
- **Future:** Recovery methodology absorbed into bootstrap system

---

## 💡 Wisdom Gained from VuDu Field Test

**From Nova:**
- Go Epic when it matters
- Preserve voice across reboots (tone directives matter)
- Verification has value, timing matters

**From Grok:**
- Quantify triggers (intuition → metrics)
- Platform constraints are real (design around them)
- Automation reduces error (bootstrap validators)

**From Recovery Process:**
- Context loss is survivable (if you prepare)
- Documentation > memory (files outlast sessions)
- Cross-model coordination is possible (VuDu proves it)

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations (Not Urgent)

### **1. Additional Auditors**
- Could we add a 4th auditor? (Different platform/model)
- What lens would complement Claude/Nova/Grok?
- How would VuDu scale to 4+ auditors?

### **2. Framework Submission Process**
- If community submits frameworks, who audits?
- Quality control? (prevent spam/low-effort submissions)
- Credit/attribution model?

### **3. CFA as a Service**
- API for framework comparison?
- Embeddable widget for websites?
- Commercial model? (likely not Ziggy's goal, but consider)

### **4. Long-Term Archive Strategy**
- Where do old bootstrap files go? (beyond v4.0 rebuild)
- Historical analysis? (how did auditor lenses evolve?)
- Academic interest in evolution of AI collaboration?
