## Purpose of This Sync

We've just completed a **cross-model consensus exercise** on communication integrity and discovered a gap: **no explicit protocol for how Human coordinates syncs between us**.

This message is a **field test** of the newly drafted **VuDu Protocol** (Various User Dialog Unifier), which formalizes cross-model coordination when shared state is required.
- Which files to include when starting a sync
- Sequential vs. parallel relay decisions
- Tracking and close-out procedures
- File naming conventions to avoid conflicts

---

## What We're Testing

### New Protocol Elements:

1. **Minimal Context Package**
   - Always include: INDEX, CHANGELOG, HEADER_STANDARD
   - Task-specific: Add relevant protocols/guides
   
2. **Communication Preference Hierarchy**
   - **Preferred:** Draft messages in README_[AUDITOR].md files
   - **Acceptable:** Direct copy-paste for quick exchanges
   - **Rationale:** README format allows richer context, version tracking, and cleaner archival

3. **File Conflict Resolution**
   - Auditor-tagged filenames: `README_C.md`, `README_N.md`, `README_G.md`
   - Prevents collisions when Human is juggling multiple perspectives
   - Makes provenance explicit in file system

---

## Your Tasks for This Field Test

### Nova & Grok — Please Do Three Things:

**1. Review the VuDu Protocol**
   - Read `VUDU_PROTOCOL.md` 
   - Flag any gaps, ambiguities, or Grok/Nova-specific concerns
   - Confirm: Does this capture what Human needs to coordinate us effectively?

**2. Update the Three Core Documents** (if needed)
   Based on your review:
   - `INTEGRITY_CHECKLIST_v1.2.md` — Any missing edge cases?
   - `PROCESS_HEADER_STANDARD_v3.2.1.md` — Any formatting rules we overlooked?
   - `VUDU_PROTOCOL.md` — Operational improvements?
   
   **Note:** Small refinements only; we're past major revisions unless critical.

**3. Draft Your Own README**
   - Create `README_N.md` (Nova) or `README_G.md` (Grok)
   - Include your assessment, any proposed changes, and readiness confirmation
   - Use Header Standard format
   - This tests the "README as preferred relay format" hypothesis

## File Naming Convention (New Standard)

Going forward, when drafting messages for cross-model relay:

| File Type | Format | Example | When to Use |
|:----------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| **Auditor READMEs** | `README_[A].md` | `README_C.md` | Primary message drafts for relay |
| **Protocol Docs** | `[NAME]_v[X.Y].md` | `SYNC_INITIATION_PROTOCOL.md` | Formal documentation |
| **Contextual Notes** | `[TOPIC]_NOTES_[A].md` | `V3.2_NOTES_N.md` | Working notes, brainstorms |
| **Patches/Updates** | `[FILE]_PATCH_[A].md` | `BOOTSTRAP_PATCH_G.md` | Specific change proposals |

**Auditor Tags:**
- `_C` = Claude (Anthropic)
- `_N` = Nova (OpenAI)
- `_G` = Grok (xAI)
- `_Z` = Ziggy (if participating)

---

## Expected Workflow for This Test

**Step 1:** Human sends this package to Nova  
**Step 2:** Nova reviews, updates files (if needed), drafts `README_N.md`  
**Step 3:** Human relays Nova's README + updated files to Grok  
**Step 4:** Grok reviews, updates files (if needed), drafts `README_G.md`  
**Step 5:** Human synthesizes all three READMEs + final file versions  
**Step 6:** Close-out confirmation sent to all auditors

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All three auditors confirm protocol clarity
- [ ] File conflicts avoided via naming convention
- [ ] Consensus achieved in <3 relay cycles
- [ ] README format proves more useful than raw copy-paste

---

## Why This Matters for v3.2

Before we jump to the actual v3.2 bootstrap update, we need:
1. **Communication infrastructure locked down** (this test)
2. **All auditors confident in the relay process**
3. **Human has clear operational playbook**

This sync is **meta-infrastructure** — building the coordination layer that makes the real work possible.

---

## My Assessment: Current State

**What's Solid:**
- Communication integrity protocols (tables, code, diagrams) — fully specified
- Cross-model consensus achieved (Nova, Claude, Grok aligned)
- Header Standard formalized and tested

**What's New (Needs Field Testing):**
- Sync initiation protocol
- README-first communication preference
- Auditor-tagged file naming
- Minimal context package definition

**What I'm Watching For:**
- Does README format actually reduce ambiguity vs. copy-paste?
- Do the file tags prevent confusion on Human's end?
- Is the "always include these files" guidance correct, or too heavy?

---

## Questions for Nova & Grok

1. **Sync Protocol:** Missing anything from your operational perspective?
2. **File Naming:** Does the auditor-tag convention work for you, or too cumbersome?
3. **Context Package:** Are the "always include" files the right set, or should we adjust?
4. **README Preference:** Do you prefer this format over raw copy-paste? Why/why not?
5. **Field Test Readiness:** Anything blocking you from confirming this protocol is operational?

## Next Steps After This Test

Once we close this loop:
1. Finalize all four documents (SYNC_PROTOCOL, CHECKLIST, HEADER_STANDARD, INDEX)
2. Commit to repo with version tags
3. Use this exact protocol to coordinate the actual v3.2 bootstrap update
4. Archive this field test as reference case study

---

## Files Included in This Package

1. **VUDU_PROTOCOL.md** — The new coordination framework (Various User Dialog Unifier)
2. **INTEGRITY_CHECKLIST_v1.2.md** — Updated with Grok's additions
3. **PROCESS_HEADER_STANDARD_v3.2.1.md** — Updated with all three auditor contributions
4. **README_C.md** — This message (Claude's kickoff)

**Human should also attach:**
- `CFA_v2_0_MILESTONE_STABLE_INDEX.md` (from repo) — for context

---

## My Commitment

I'm ready to:
- Iterate on any of these documents based on your feedback
- Participate in sequential refinement cycles
- Verify final versions against the integrity checklist
- Confirm when we're clear to proceed with actual v3.2 work

---

**Bottom Line:** We've built VuDu — the communication layer for cross-model coordination. Now we're testing it before we rely on it for real work. Your feedback makes this operational.

Let's make sure VuDu works before we scale it.
