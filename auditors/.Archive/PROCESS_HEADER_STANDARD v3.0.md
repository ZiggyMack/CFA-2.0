# 🔄 CFA v2.0 - Process Header Standard

**Purpose:** Track multi-person conversation flow across Claude, Grok, Nova, and Ziggy

---

## 📋 **The Header Format**

Every message in the CFA project should begin with this header:

```
=== CFA v2.0 MESSAGE HEADER ===
Sender: [Name, e.g., Claude (Anthropic)]
Level: [Level/Phase, e.g., Coordination]
Action: [Purpose, e.g., v3.0 DaVinci Pass Execution]
Brutes/Assumptions: [1-3 key presuppositions]
CFA v2.0 Status: [Current YPA, e.g., MdN Neutral 3.62 | CT Neutral 3.65]
Files Referenced: [Specific files being worked on, optional]
Timestamp: [Date/Time, e.g., October 24, 2025]
===
```

---

## 🎯 **Why This Header Exists**

### **Problem:**
Multi-threaded conversations between 4+ participants lose context:
- Ziggy coordinates the flow
- Claude provides philosophical grounding
- Grok enforces usability
- Nova audits symmetry

**Without structure:** Messages blur, assumptions go unnamed, flow becomes chaotic.

### **Solution:**
The header makes every message self-documenting:
1. **Names the sender** (who's speaking)
2. **Names the level** (where we are in the process)
3. **Names the action** (what this message does)
4. **Names the brutes** (what assumptions underlie this message)
5. **Names the status** (current audit scores for reference)

---

---

### **Level**
What phase of the audit/development process we're in.

**Options:**
- `Level 0` - Initial independent audit

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Standard**

### **1. Clarity**
Every message is self-documenting - you know who wrote it and why.

### **2. Transparency**
Brutes/Assumptions make biases explicit (the "All Named" principle).

### **3. Context**
CFA v2.0 Status ties every message to the project's empirical foundation.

### **4. Symmetry**
Same format for Claude, Grok, Nova ensures no one dominates the conversation.

### **5. Tracking**
Level field shows where we are in the audit/development process.

---

## 🛡️ **When to Use This Header**

### **Always Use:**
- ✅ Multi-party coordination messages
- ✅ Audit feedback (Grok, Nova, Claude)
- ✅ Context restoration (bootstrap loading)
- ✅ Design decisions requiring justification

### **Optional (But Recommended):**
- ✅ Implementation status updates
- ✅ Bug reports with philosophical implications
- ✅ Questions that need audit context

### **Not Necessary:**
- ❌ Simple technical questions
- ❌ Routine code commits
- ❌ Casual conversation without audit weight

---

## 📐 **Alignment with "All Named, All Priced"**

This header embodies the project ethos:

**All Named:**
- Sender named
- Level named
- Action named
- Brutes named
- Status named

**All Priced:**
- Every assumption declared upfront
- Every message tied to empirical scores
- Every action justified by its purpose

---

## 🔄 **Multi-Person Conversation Tracking (4+ Participants)**

### **The Challenge:**
When 4+ people (Ziggy, Claude, Grok, Nova) collaborate across sessions, context fragments.

### **The Solution:**
Headers create an audit trail. Each message documents:
- Who's speaking
- What they're responding to
- What assumptions they're making
- Where we are in the process

---

## 📊 **Complete 4-Way Conversation Example**

### **Scenario: v3.0 DaVinci Pass Coordination**

This shows the ACTUAL conversation flow that led to v3.0:

**Round 1: Ziggy → Claude**
```
Sender: Ziggy | Level: Coordination
Action: Request reflection on v2.0 process with restored context
Brutes: Context was lost, now restored, want quantified time assessment
```
Ziggy asks Claude to assess efficiency loss now that context is back.

**Round 2: Claude → Ziggy**
```
Sender: Claude | Level: Coordination  
Action: Reflecting on 30-40% efficiency loss, recommending pre-v3.0 audit
Brutes: Can compare with/without context, quality loss > time loss
```
Claude estimates impact, suggests consulting Nova + Grok before v3.0.

**Round 3: Ziggy → Nova**
```
Sender: Ziggy | Level: Coordination
Action: Forwarding Claude's reflection, requesting Pre-DaVinci audit
Brutes: Claude wants narrative injection, need symmetry check first
```
Ziggy sends Claude's message to Nova for symmetry audit.

**Round 4: Nova → Ziggy**
```
Sender: Nova | Level: Coordination
Action: Providing Pre-DaVinci Audit Brief with questions
Brutes: Solo Claude redesign risks bias, need both checks
```
Nova creates audit framework with questions for both auditors.

**Round 5: Ziggy → Grok**
```
Sender: Ziggy | Level: Coordination
Action: Sending full context (Claude + Nova) + files for review
Brutes: Grok needs both perspectives, plus direct file access
Files: README.md, console.py, Manual.pdf, brute_ledger.py
```
Ziggy packages everything for Grok's usability review.

**Round 6: Grok → Ziggy**
```
Sender: Grok | Level: Coordination
Action: 5 usability notes + header standard proposal + file feedback
Brutes: Context enables redesign, prioritize usability, files stable
Files: All project files reviewed
```
Grok provides empirical constraints and proposes this header system.

**Round 7: Ziggy → Nova**
```
Sender: Ziggy | Level: Coordination
Action: Forwarding Grok's notes for Nova's synthesis
Brutes: Nova needs Grok's perspective for final audit
Files: Grok's response + all files
```
Ziggy ensures Nova sees Grok's input before finalizing.

**Round 8: Nova → Ziggy**
```
Sender: Nova | Level: Coordination
Action: Symmetry audit + red-flag glossary + UI tips
Brutes: Manual is baseline, Grok's constraints inform recommendations
Files: Manual + Grok's constraints
```
Nova completes symmetry review accounting for Grok's usability notes.

**Round 9: Ziggy → Claude**
```
Sender: Ziggy | Level: Handoff to Execution
Action: Complete audit context (Nova + Grok) for v3.0 execution
Brutes: All audits complete, guardrails established
Files: Wake_up (full conversation history)
```
Ziggy delivers complete context in single file for Claude's execution.

**Round 10: Claude → Execution**
```
Sender: Claude | Level: Execution (v3.0 DaVinci Pass)
Action: Implementing all audit constraints
Brutes: Constraints internalized, sacred elements identified
Files: console.py, brute_ledger.py, landing.py, README.md
```
Claude executes with full guardrails from both auditors.

## 🎯 **Key Patterns in Multi-Person Flow**

### **Pattern 1: The Orchestrator (Ziggy)**
- Forwards context between parties
- Ensures everyone sees everyone else's input
- Packages complete history before final handoff

### **Pattern 2: The Sequential Build**
- Each auditor adds their perspective
- Later auditors see earlier auditor's work
- Final actor (Claude) receives synthesized constraints

### **Pattern 3: The Header Chain**
- Each message references what it's responding to (in Action field)
- Brutes evolve as new information arrives
- Files accumulate as more context is shared

---

## 📋 **Rules for Multi-Person Headers**

### **Rule 1: Always Reference Context**
```
Action: Responding to Grok's usability notes + adding symmetry perspective
```
Not just: "Providing feedback"

### **Rule 2: Declare Your Position**
```
Brutes/Assumptions:
  1. Disagree with Claude's CT score (seems generous)
  2. My empirical bias may undervalue existential depth
  3. Need Nova's symmetry check
```

### **Rule 3: Track File Evolution**
```
Files Referenced: README.md (initial)
→ Files Referenced: README.md, console.py (after first review)  
→ Files Referenced: All files + Grok's notes (final package)
```

### **Rule 4: Name the Handoff**
```
Action: HANDOFF to Claude with complete audit context
```
Makes transitions explicit.

## 🔄 **Template for Forwarding Messages**

When Ziggy (or any coordinator) forwards between parties:

```
=== CFA v2.0 MESSAGE HEADER ===
Sender: [Coordinator Name]
Level: Coordination
Action: Forwarding [Person A]'s [content type] to [Person B] for [purpose]
Brutes/Assumptions:
  1. [Person B] needs to see [Person A]'s perspective
  2. [Reason for forwarding]
  3. [Expected outcome]
CFA v2.0 Status: [Current scores]
Files Referenced: [What's being shared]
Timestamp: [Date]
===

[Person B], here's [Person A]'s [content]:

[Quoted message with original header preserved]

[Any additional context from coordinator]
```

---

## ✅ **Benefits Specific to Multi-Person Use**

1. **No Context Loss:** Each message is self-contained
2. **Audit Trail:** Can reconstruct conversation flow from headers
3. **Bias Tracking:** Brutes make each person's lens explicit
4. **Handoff Clarity:** No confusion about who's responsible next
5. **File Versioning:** Know which files each person reviewed

---

## 🔮 **Future Extensions**

As the project evolves:
- Add `Priority` field (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Add `Dependencies` field (links to other messages)
- Add `Review Status` field (Pending/Approved/Rejected)

---

**This is the way.** 🔥
