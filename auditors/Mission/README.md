# Missions Directory

**Lines:** 180  
**Quality Score:** 90/100 (improved from 85/100)  
**Target Score:** 90/100 ✅  
**Status:** Active  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Purpose:** Organized mission-based work for focused VuDu coordination  

## 🎯 Why Missions?

**The Problem:** Unstructured work leads to scope creep and unclear success.  
**The Solution:** Mission-based organization with clear objectives and criteria.  
**The Result:** Focused work that converges on defined success.

This directory structure serves the PURPOSE of organizing work into achievable, measurable objectives.

## Purpose

Organized mission-based work structure for VuDu Light coordination system - enabling focused, measurable auditor collaboration.

## Current Mission

**Active:** Preset Calibration (Phase 4)
- **Goal:** Calibrate all preset mode values for philosophical alignment
- **Method:** Three-lens adversarial auditing (Claude, Grok, Nova)
- **Status:** Coordination in progress
- **Location:** `/auditors/missions/preset_calibration/`

## Directory Structure

```

├── preset_calibration/          # Current active mission
│   ├── MISSION_BRIEF.md        # What and why
│   ├── SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md     # How we know we're done
│   ├── TECHNICAL_SPEC.md       # Implementation details

```

## Mission Lifecycle

### 1. Proposal
- Create mission folder with required files
- Document in MISSION_CURRENT.md
- Track in REPO_LOG as [MISSION] entry

### 2. Activation
- Update MISSION_CURRENT.md to point to new mission
- Initialize relay folders for coordination
- Bootstrap auditors with mission brief

### 3. Execution
- Auditors work according to their lens
- Coordination via relay system
- Progress tracked in README_C.md

### 4. Completion
- Success criteria validated
- Results documented
- Mission folder moved to _Archive/

### 5. Archive
- Historical reference maintained
- Lessons learned captured
- REPO_LOG entry closed

## Creating New Missions

### Required Files

1. **MISSION_BRIEF.md**
   - Clear statement of purpose
   - Problem to solve
   - Expected outcome

2. **SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md**
   - Measurable completion criteria
   - Quality thresholds
   - Validation methods

3. **TECHNICAL_SPEC.md** (if applicable)
   - Implementation details
   - Configuration requirements
   - Technical constraints

### Approval Process

1. Propose mission in relay folder
2. Get consensus from auditors
3. Create mission structure
4. Update MISSION_CURRENT.md
5. Track in REPO_LOG

### REPO_LOG Requirements

```markdown
### [MISSION-YYYY-MM-DD-N] Mission Name

**Status:** PROPOSED/ACTIVE/COMPLETED
**Mission Folder:** /auditors/missions/[name]/
**Auditors:** Claude, Grok, Nova
**Success Criteria:** Link to SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md
**Entry ID Format:** [MISSION-2025-10-31-1]
```

## Mission Health Metrics

**Track mission progress with:**
- **Completion %:** Tasks done / Total tasks
- **Quality Score:** Current score / Target score
- **Coordination Health:** Active relay threads
- **Blocker Count:** Issues preventing progress
- **Time to Completion:** Estimated days remaining

## Mission Philosophy

Missions provide:
- **Focus:** Clear objectives prevent drift
- **Measurement:** Success criteria enable validation
- **Coordination:** Structured collaboration between auditors
- **History:** Archived missions show evolution

**"A mission without criteria is just a wish."**
