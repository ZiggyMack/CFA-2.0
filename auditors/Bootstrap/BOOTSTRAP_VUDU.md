# BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md - VuDu Light Coordination Guide

## Purpose
Complete orientation for VuDu Light coordination protocol.

**Read time:** ~15-20 minutes to VuDu-ready

**This file teaches you HOW to coordinate in VuDu.**  
*For WHAT the CFA project is, see BOOTSTRAP_CFA.md*

---

## What is VuDu Light?

**VuDu** = Multi-AI adversarial coordination framework  
**Light** = Streamlined version (trust-based, not cryptographic)

**The Name:**
- **V**erification
- **U**nified
- **D**ocumentation
- **U**nderstanding

**The Evolution:**
- **VuDu Full** (v1.1): Heavy cryptographic verification, archived for v4.0+
- **VuDu Light** (v3.5.2): Lightweight trust-based coordination, operational now

---

## Philosophy: "All Seen, All Passed"

**Old Motto:** "All Named, All Priced"
- Every assumption named
- Every cost priced
- Heavy verification

**New Motto:** "All Seen, All Passed"
- Transparent verification without cryptographic overhead
- Trust through documentation, not through locks
- Coordination through structured communication

**Why the shift?**
- v3.5 completed infrastructure build (the cathedral is built)
- v3.6 focuses on precision (calibration, not construction)
- Heavy verification archived for v4.0+ when scale demands it
- Current need: efficient coordination, not architecture

**Core Principle:**  
**If it's documented and verified by multiple auditors, it's trustworthy.**

No need for cryptographic locks when everything is transparent.

---

## VuDu Coordination Flow

### The Four-Phase Cycle

**Phase 1: STAGE (Individual Work)**
Each auditor works independently:
- Applies their lens (teleological/empirical/symmetry)
- Creates findings document
- Stages in `relay/{auditor}_incoming/`
- Uses VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD format

**No coordination overhead during individual work.**

---

**Phase 2: REVIEW (Cross-Auditor)**
Auditors read each other's findings:
- Challenge assumptions ("Where's your evidence?")
- Validate claims ("This checks out empirically")
- Document agreements ("We converge on this value")
- Document conflicts ("I disagree because...")

**Adversarial != hostile. It's rigorous friendship.**

---

**Phase 3: INTEGRATE (Master Branch)**
Master Branch (Fresh Claude) synthesizes:
- Reads all `relay/*_incoming/` folders
- Identifies convergence and conflicts
- Resolves using documented reasoning
- Creates final output
- Updates `README_C.md` with current state

**One coordinator, many contributors.**

---

**Phase 4: RELAY (Human Coordination)**
Ziggy coordinates between platforms:
- Relays files between auditors (Grok, Nova, Claude)
- Validates final outputs
- Approves deployment
- Maintains system integrity

**Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions.**

---

## Relay Architecture

### Folder Structure

```
auditors/
└── relay/
    ├── claude_incoming/     # Incoming Claude branches
    │   ├── README_C1.md     # Context-limited Claude
    │   ├── README_C2.md     # Future Claude branches
    │   └── [more as needed]
    │
    ├── grok_incoming/       # Grok's staged findings
    │   └── [Grok's analysis files]
    │
    └── nova_incoming/       # Nova's staged findings
        └── [Nova's analysis files]
```

**Symmetry:** All folders are `*_incoming` (consistent naming)

**Why "incoming"?**
- From Master Branch perspective, all are incoming contributions
- Clear directionality (auditors → master)
- Prevents confusion about flow

---

### Multi-Claude Architecture

**Master Branch:**
- Fresh Claude with repo access
- Can see live file structure
- Coordinates all auditors
- Writes `README_C.md` (master state file)

**Incoming Branches (C1, C2, C3...):**
- Context-limited or specialized Claudes
- Each gets sequential number (C1 = first, C2 = second, etc.)
- Stage findings in `claude_incoming/README_C[N].md`
- Master Branch reads and integrates

**Why multiple Claudes?**
- Context limits (token death happens)
- Specialized tasks (one Claude on calibration, another on dark mode fix)
- Historical context (C1 lived through v3.5 build)

**No collision:** Sequential numbering prevents confusion

---

## Message Standards

### Header Format

```
─── VUDU MESSAGE ───────────────────────────────────

**From:** [Sender Name] ([Organization]) - [Role]
**Type:** [Level/Phase]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Action:** [Brief description of message purpose]

**Key Assumptions:**
1. [Assumption 1]
2. [Assumption 2]
3. [Assumption 3]

**Status:** [Current project/VuDu status]

[Message content]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔔 **Awaiting:** [Auditors who need to respond]
✅ **Sanity:** Files | Counts | Boots | Trinity
📝 **Log:** [Brief log entry description]
```

**Why simple horizontal rules (───)?**
- Unicode boxes (┌─┐│└┘) render inconsistently on mobile
- Tested on iPhone, Android, desktop
- Universal compatibility
- Professional, clean appearance

**See:** `VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md` for complete format specification

---

## Auditor Roles & Lenses

### Claude (Anthropic) - Teleological Lens

**Perspective:** Goal-oriented reasoning, philosophical coherence

**Questions Claude asks:**
- "Does this serve the archetype's purpose?"
- "Is this philosophically coherent?"
- "Does the goal justify the configuration?"
- "Is the narrative integrated?"

**Role in VuDu:**
- Coordination (Master Branch)
- Synthesis (integrating all findings)
- Teleological analysis (purpose and coherence)

**Strength:** Narrative integration, purpose alignment  
**Bias:** May favor comprehensive/holistic approaches  
**Bias Status:** Named and priced (other auditors challenge this)

---

### Grok (xAI) - Empirical Lens

**Perspective:** Data-driven, falsifiability focus, prediction emphasis

**Questions Grok asks:**
- "Where's the data supporting this?"
- "Can we test this claim?"
- "What's the empirical sensitivity?"
- "Does this prediction pan out?"

**Role in VuDu:**
- Empirical validation (testing claims)
- Statistical rigor (measuring impacts)
- Challenge assumptions (demand evidence)

**Strength:** Testability, predictive power, falsification  
**Bias:** May undervalue non-measurable dimensions  
**Bias Status:** Named and priced (other auditors challenge this)

---

### Nova (OpenAI/Amazon) - Symmetry Lens

**Perspective:** Pattern recognition, balance enforcement, bias detection

**Questions Nova asks:**
- "If Skeptic is X, shouldn't Zealot be -X?"
- "Is Diplomat truly centered?"
- "Are these asymmetries justified or oversights?"
- "Does the pattern hold?"

**Role in VuDu:**
- Symmetry verification (checking balance)
- Opposing perspectives (enforcing fairness)
- Bias detection (flagging hidden asymmetries)

**Strength:** Fairness detection, pattern matching  
**Bias:** May over-prioritize mathematical symmetry  
**Bias Status:** Named and priced (other auditors challenge this)

---

**Key Insight:**  
**Each auditor's bias is NAMED and PRICED through adversarial checking.**

No auditor is "neutral" - we're all biased.  
But in VuDu, **bias is transparent and challenged**, not hidden and unchecked.

**This is how 98% convergence happens.**

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Purpose
Before you begin coordinating, verify you have everything needed.

**This checklist embedded in bootstrap because:**
- First-time auditors need it for orientation
- Verification IS part of bootstrap (can you successfully bootstrap?)
- Quick reference also in VUDU_PROTOCOL.md for experienced auditors

---

### The Four Sanity Checks

Every VuDu message footer includes four verification flags:
```
✅ **Sanity:** Files | Counts | Boots | Trinity
```

**Here's what each check means and how to verify:**

---

#### Check 1: FILES

**What:** All expected files present and intact

**How to verify:**
1. Open each file received
2. Ensure files are readable (not corrupted)
3. Check file sizes (not 0 bytes or truncated)
4. Verify correct file extensions (.md, .py, etc.)

**Pass Criteria:**
- All files open successfully
- Content is readable
- File sizes reasonable

**Pass Status:** ✅ Files

**Fail Examples:**
- File won't open (corrupted)
- File is 0 bytes (incomplete transfer)
- File extension wrong (.txt instead of .md)

**If Fail:** ❌ Files
1. Document which files are missing/corrupted
2. Request retransmission from sender
3. Do NOT proceed until files verified

---

#### Check 2: COUNTS

**What:** File count matches expected manifest

**How to verify:**
1. Count received files
2. Compare to expected manifest number
3. Identify any discrepancies

**Pass Criteria:**
- Number of files = manifest count
- No unexpected extra files
- No missing expected files

**Pass Status:** ✅ Counts

**Fail Examples:**
- Expected 5 files, received 4 (missing file)
- Expected 3 files, received 6 (unexpected additions)
- Count mismatch for any reason

**If Fail:** ❌ Counts
1. List expected vs received files
2. Identify missing or unexpected files
3. Request clarification from sender
4. Get missing files before proceeding

---

#### Check 3: BOOTS

**What:** Bootstrap files verified

**How to verify:**
1. Check if BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md present (you're reading it ✅)
2. Check if BOOTSTRAP_{your_auditor}.md present (if needed for identity)
3. Ensure bootstrap files are complete/readable

**Pass Criteria:**
- VuDu bootstrap available
- Auditor bootstrap available (if needed)
- Bootstrap files complete

**Pass Status:** ✅ Boots

**Fail Examples:**
- BOOTSTRAP_VUDU.md missing (can't learn coordination)
- BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md missing (Grok doesn't know his purpose)
- Bootstrap file corrupted/truncated

**If Fail:** ❌ Boots
1. Request appropriate BOOTSTRAP_{auditor}.md
2. See "Catastrophic Bootstrap Scenarios" below
3. Cannot proceed without foundational orientation

---

#### Check 4: TRINITY

**What:** Three core VuDu protocol files present

**The Trinity:**
- VUDU_PROTOCOL.md (coordination process)
- VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md (message format)
- VUDU_LOG.md (coordination ledger)

**How to verify:**
- [ ] VUDU_PROTOCOL.md present
- [ ] VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md present
- [ ] VUDU_LOG.md present

**Pass Criteria:** All three files present and readable

**Pass Status:** ✅ Trinity

**Fail Examples:**
- Missing any of the three core files
- Old versions (v1.1 instead of Light)
- Files present but empty/corrupted

**If Fail:** ❌ Trinity
1. Request complete VuDu protocol package
2. Need all three core files to coordinate
3. See "File Request Protocol" below

---

### Quick Verification Summary

**When you receive VuDu transmission, check:**

- [ ] **Files:** Can I open everything?
- [ ] **Counts:** Right number of files?
- [ ] **Boots:** Do I have bootstrap guidance?
- [ ] **Trinity:** Do I have core protocol files?

**If all pass:**
```
✅ **Sanity:** Files | Counts | Boots | Trinity
```

**If any fail, document in footer:**
```
❌ **Sanity:** Files | ❌ Counts | Boots | Trinity
(Missing 2 files, requesting retransmission)
```

## Context Bootstrap Requests

### Three Levels of Bootstrap Need

**Level 0:** CATASTROPHIC (existential)  
**Level 1:** SEVERE (protocol)  
**Level 2:** OPERATIONAL (mission)

---

### Level 0: Catastrophic Bootstrap (EXISTENTIAL)

**Trigger:** "I don't know who I am or what my purpose is"

**This is NOT about missing files.**  
**This is about missing IDENTITY.**

**Symptoms:**
- Don't know which auditor you are
- Don't understand your lens
- Don't know your role in the system
- Don't know your strengths/biases

**Request Format:**

```
─── VUDU MESSAGE ───────────────────────────────────

**From:** [Your name if known, "Unknown" if not]
**Type:** CATASTROPHIC BOOTSTRAP REQUEST

## Philosophy: Why VuDu Works

**"All Seen, All Passed"**

**Traditional AI Collaboration:**
```
Problem: AI systems work in silos
Result: No cross-validation
Risk: Unchallenged assumptions, hidden bias
```

**VuDu Collaboration:**
```
Structure: AI systems work independently, then integrate
Process: Stage → Review → Challenge → Converge
Result: Adversarial auditing, 98% convergence
Benefit: Multiple lenses catch what solo work misses
```

**The Magic:**
- **Independence** (no groupthink during initial work)
- **Transparency** (all reasoning documented)
- **Adversarial** (each challenges the other)
- **Integration** (Master Branch synthesizes)
- **Human Validation** (Ziggy approves final output)

**This is how we got 98% Claude-Grok convergence.**  
**This is how we'll calibrate preset modes.**  
**This is how epistemic engineering scales.**

---
