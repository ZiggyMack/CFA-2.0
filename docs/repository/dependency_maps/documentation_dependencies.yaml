  update_checklist: |
    When changing preset count or configuration:
    1. Update README.md feature list (count + names)
    2. Modify console.py PRESET_CONFIGS dictionary
    3. Adjust SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md validation targets
    4. Update all "4 modes" or "four presets" references
    5. Test manual.py display for new mode
    6. Update MISSION_CURRENT.md if during calibration
    7. Create REPO_LOG entry with all changes
    8. Run validation to ensure consistency

  validation: |
    After structure change:
    - Test all import statements
    - Verify setup instructions work
    - Check deployment procedures
    - Update tree diagrams

# ===== NOTES =====

implementation_notes: |
  This registry is the source of truth for documentation dependencies.
  
  Priority Levels:
  - primary: MUST update (breakage if not updated)
  - secondary: SHOULD update (confusion if not updated)  
  - tertiary: NICE to update (completeness)
  
  Stability Levels:
  - stable: Changes rarely (yearly or less)
  - occasional: Changes sometimes (monthly)
  - frequent: Changes often (weekly)
  - volatile: Changes constantly (daily)
  
  Usage:
  1. Before changing a feature, check this registry
  2. Use update_checklist for systematic updates
  3. Add new features as they're identified
  4. Audit quarterly for accuracy

validation_rules: |
  A well-formed entry must have:
  - stability level
  - documented_in list with at least one primary
  - last_changed date
  - owner designation
  
  Optional but recommended:
  - depends_on list
  - update_checklist
  - notes
  - validation steps
