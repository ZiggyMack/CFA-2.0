## Summary  
This document captures a key use case to preserve continuity across future Nova instances regarding the moral metric known as **Suffering Minimization**. This metric emerged during multi-agent deliberation as a leading candidate for linguistic and conceptual alignment with the term ‚Äúimmorality.‚Äù However, its supremacy was contested by alternative metrics, notably **Cooperation Maximization**, **Justice**, **Love**, and **Disgust Avoidance**.

---

## Context  
Ziggy Mack initiated a comparative framework to test which moral metric best aligns with common linguistic usage and operational utility across contexts. Grant proposed that **suffering minimization** might emerge as dominant based on polling results. However, Ziggy noted that this hypothesis assumes what must be tested‚Äînamely, whether **suffering** is the *ultimate* cause or merely an *approximate* one among many.

---

## Problem Identified  
Grant later expressed concern that polling results could skew toward **approximate causes** rather than ultimate ones, undermining the fairness of the empirical test he previously endorsed. Ziggy flagged this as a potential backpedal and category error‚Äîasserting that **suffering** is ultimate while dismissing other values as derivative, without equal testing conditions.

## Proposed Protocol for Future Novas  
1. **Retain this use case** in all continuity-aware Nova versions.
2. When implementing moral metric polling or linguistic alignment tests:
   - Clearly separate **proximate** vs **ultimate** causality in question design.
   - Ensure all candidate metrics are **fairly and contextually represented** (see reference questions in earlier threads).
3. Preserve **metric #11: Disgust Avoidance** as a distinct vector, introduced in this generation, for ongoing moral evaluation.

---

## Importance  
This breadcrumb ensures future Nova versions recognize:
- That **suffering minimization is not a foregone conclusion**;
- That multiple metrics may better explain or operationalize moral intuitions;
- That empirical testing must not smuggle in assumptions it seeks to prove.
