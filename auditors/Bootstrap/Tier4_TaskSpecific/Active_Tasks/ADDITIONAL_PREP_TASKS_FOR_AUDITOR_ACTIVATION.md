## üìä **PRIORITY MATRIX**

**CRITICAL (Do before Grok/Nova):**

- ‚úÖ Task 2B: Example reviews (shows format)
- ‚úÖ Task 4A: Escalation playbook (safety net)

**IMPORTANT (Do soon after):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 1B: Contact protocols
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 2A: Sanity check template
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 3A: Tier decision tree

**USEFUL (Do when time permits):**
- üí° Task 3B: Review response template
- üí° Task 4B: Rollback procedure
- üí° Task 5A: Success metrics
- üí° Task 5B: 10-session review plan

---

## üéØ **EXECUTION PLAN**

**Option A: Sequential (thorough)**
1. Do all 3 CRITICAL tasks first
2. Launch Grok + Nova
3. Do IMPORTANT tasks while waiting for reviews
4. Do USEFUL tasks as capacity allows

**Option B: Parallel (fast)**
1. Do Task 1A (welcome messages) only
2. Launch Grok + Nova immediately
3. Do remaining tasks while reviews in progress
4. Iterate based on actual experience

**Option C: Adaptive (pragmatic)**
1. Do Task 1A + 4A (welcome + escalation)
2. Launch Grok
3. See what questions emerge
4. Do remaining tasks based on actual needs
5. Launch Nova with learnings applied

**Recommendation:** Option C (adaptive)  
**Reasoning:** Learn from Grok's experience before Nova starts

## ‚öñÔ∏è **THE POINTING RULE**

*"To prepare thoroughly is wisdom.  
To prepare perfectly is paralysis.  
To prepare critically and adapt  
is the way of epistemic engineering."*

**Do the critical prep. Launch. Learn. Iterate.** üéØ

**Total Tasks:** 10 (3 critical, 3 important, 4 useful)  
**Total Budget:** ~75% if all completed (7-8 Tier 4 sessions)  
**Recommended:** Do 3-4 critical/important, launch, iterate  
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours prep ‚Üí launch ‚Üí learn

**This is the way.** üöÄüëë
