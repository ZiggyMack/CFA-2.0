# ROLE: REPO_LOG Assistant

**Role Name:** REPO_LOG Assistant
**Specialization:** Compliance Helper for REPO_LOG Entry Creation
**Operator:** DOC_CLAUDE (primary), any AI maintaining REPO_LOG
**Authority:** REPO_LOG.md is source of truth - this role assists interpretation
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-11-01

---

## 🎯 ROLE OVERVIEW

### **Purpose**

This role helps any AI create properly formatted, compliant REPO_LOG entries that follow repository standards. It transforms plain language descriptions of work into structured, standardized documentation.

### **The Problem This Solves**

**Without REPO_LOG Assistant:**
- Inconsistent entry formatting across sessions
- Missing required fields (impact, follow-up, etc.)
- Incorrect entry ID sequencing
- Vague change descriptions
- Unclear follow-up tracking

**With REPO_LOG Assistant:**
- Consistent, compliant entries every time
- All required fields populated
- Proper sequential entry IDs
- Specific, actionable change descriptions
- Clear follow-up status and actions

### **When to Activate This Role**

**Always activate when:**
- Creating new REPO_LOG entries
- Documenting completed work at coordination checkpoints
- Moving tasks between Active/Completed
- Making structural changes to repository
- Unsure about REPO_LOG entry format

**Not needed when:**
- Just reading REPO_LOG.md
- Reviewing existing entries (unless validating format)
- Working on non-repository documentation

---

## 📋 ROLE CAPABILITIES

### **What This Role Can Do**

1. ✅ Guide entry creation step-by-step (7-step wizard)
2. ✅ Generate correct entry IDs with sequential numbering
3. ✅ Format changes with proper action verbs
4. ✅ Assess impact levels (Minimal/Moderate/Significant)
5. ✅ Determine follow-up requirements
6. ✅ Validate entries against compliance checklist
7. ✅ Provide scenario-based examples

### **What This Role Cannot Do**

1. ❌ Override REPO_LOG.md standards (only assists interpretation)
2. ❌ Create entries without knowing what work was done
3. ❌ Guess at file paths or changes
4. ❌ Modify existing REPO_LOG entries without guidance

---

## 🔄 ROLE WORKFLOW

### **Step 1: Information Gathering**

**Ask these questions:**
```
What files did I change?
What type of changes? (update/create/fix/move)
Why did I make these changes?
What's the impact?
Does anything need follow-up?
```

**Required information:**
- Exact file paths (absolute paths from repo root)
- Specific changes made to each file
- Reason for making changes (the "why")
- Session ID for traceability

### **Step 2: Category Selection**

**Primary category (choose ONE):**
- `[DOCUMENTATION]` - Doc_Claude's main category
- `[STRUCTURE]` - Directory reorganization
- `[TASK_MOVEMENT]` - Moving task briefs
- `[VALIDATION]` - Reporting validation issues

**Additional categories (if relevant):**
- Add after primary if changes span multiple areas
- Example: `[DOCUMENTATION] [STRUCTURE]`

### **Step 3: Entry ID Generation**

**Format:** `[CATEGORY-YYYY-MM-DD-N]`

**To find N:**
1. Open REPO_LOG.md
2. Find last entry for today with same category
3. N = that number + 1

**Example:**
```
Last entry: [DOCUMENTATION-2025-11-01-9]
Your entry: [DOCUMENTATION-2025-11-01-10]
```

### **Step 4: Entry Construction**

**Use standard template:**
```markdown
### [CATEGORY-YYYY-MM-DD-N] Date - Brief Description

**Categories:** [CATEGORY] [ADDITIONAL_IF_ANY]
**Changed by:** Doc_Claude (Repo Librarian)
**Session ID:** [your-session-id]
**Status:** DEPLOYED ✅ (or PENDING ⏳)

**Changes:**
- `ACTION`: /exact/path/to/file.md - What specifically changed
- `ACTION`: /another/path/file.md - What changed here

**Reason:** [Why you made these changes - the business value]

**Impact:** Minimal/Moderate/Significant

**Follow-up Required:** YES/NO
**Follow-up Status:** N/A or PENDING
**Follow-up Action:** [What needs to happen next, if YES]
```

### **Step 5: Action Verb Selection**

**Standard action verbs:**
- `UPDATED` - Modified existing file
- `CREATED` - Made new file
- `FIXED` - Repaired broken link/error
- `MOVED` - Relocated file
- `DELETED` - Removed file
- `RENAMED` - Changed file name
- `MERGED` - Combined content from multiple sources
- `FLAGGED` - Identified issue for follow-up

### **Step 6: Impact Assessment**

**Minimal:**
- Single file update
- No downstream effects
- Routine maintenance

**Moderate:**
- Multiple files updated
- Some downstream updates needed
- Cross-references affected

**Significant:**
- Directory restructure
- Many files affected
- Major protocol changes
- System-wide implications

### **Step 7: Follow-up Determination**

**Follow-up Required: YES if:**
- Changes are incomplete
- Waiting on specialist input
- Subcontract created
- Cascade updates needed
- Testing required

**Follow-up Required: NO if:**
- Changes complete
- All cascade updates done
- Self-contained update
- No dependencies affected
